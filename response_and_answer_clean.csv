"please, can you describe your involvement in the public private partnership process under the african health diagnostic platform in rwanda?",thank much much involved ppp betweenmy employer government rwanda one introducedin framework ahdp initiative team initiated two partners led done ahdp answerin relation doneunder ahdp nothing far terms company employer government rwandai demonstrate involvement thank,1,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"who is your employer? okay so you, you are saying that you are not familiar with african health diagnostic platform, or you have heard about it.",employer abbott ive heard read ppp involved ahdp,2,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
what was the process of negotiation of the ppp you are talking about?,yeah thank much abbott idea partnering government rwanda improve laboratory services came proposal better services state arts instruments improve diagnostic services rwandan public laboratories proposal received government rwanda cabinet indorsed idea sector ministry ministry health go engagement abbott initiate partnership earlier stage feasibility study per ppp law thats negotiation initiated actually departed proposal abbott government sat together design implementation process initiate feasibility study discussion outlined every partyâ€™s responsibility order implement feasibility study,3,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"if i understood very well so abbott took initiative to propose it to the government of rwanda a model of ppp, yes?",abbott proposed services government abide laws government rwanda ppp law place would govern partnership abbott introduced different mechanism partnering government rwanda rather propose services governed ppp law place rwanda,4,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
for the abbott to propose the service to the government of rwanda how did they know what was in the need? on which basis abbott advanced its idea to propose the services?,abbott like pharmaceutical company public health company market research works many countries world services need platforms utilization includes hiv testing services abbott new rwanda definitely need wanted turn need demand apple didnt machines wanted get new market wanted get differently many countries abbott done ppp model ppp supply customer relationship ppp new thing wanted start rwanda actually new market thats come idea allowed conduct baseline assessments come proposal based facts based data place,5,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"thank you very much for this. and we are really interested to know about this experience of abbott, because we can base on it maybe for the future development. ",saying random law clear ppp solicitation government private partner services partnership dont go feasibility proof concepts given weve gone feasibility study sign supplier private company approached fast government rwanda official information available doesnt mean probably didnt talk officials probably talked solicited government,6,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"this is very good, so how abbott come in to negotiate with rwanda to contract with the government? how the negotiations went on? ",yeah thank much understood properly think negotiation means discussing terms render services cost thenactually take two parameters cost services package abbotttry bring meaninnovations would solve many challenges faced rwanda like supply chain example abbottbrought solutions would solve issues expiries stock outs stocks laboratories,7,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"what was the sticking point around these negotiations, was it accepted as proposed? ",yeah like side government rwanda see one accepting higher price point could give maybe one one mention government didnt want spend used spend similar services even though interested course additional services didnt want spend,8,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
how did you solve to include the additional services and maintain the price? ,yeah lot done terms price setting course look many parameters may cut operational costs abbott losing reducing price strategies keeping costs price many dimensions areas cut like operational costs anything accepting price abbott found way losing keeping business viable,9,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
did the services continue to be offered as proposed initially or changed according to the price?,theres nothing changed actually price reduced,10,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"yeah. thank you very much. so, who was involved in this initial design of the ppp negotiation? ",course two parties abbott government rwanda government rwanda many governmental institutions especially sector ministry ministry health ministry finance somehow related finance economic development rdb charge businesses ppp well also think rpp ministry finance economic planning hospitals managers also represented instruments installed hospitals side government formed forum composed representatives institutions called steering committee per ppp law addition two parties abbott government another partner government rwanda chai kind supporting government rwanda providing technical assistance logistical assistance activities related implementing ppp starting feasibility study take place smoothly three chai government rwanda abbott parties place make sure ppp takes place,11,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
that's very good does rssb were involved? ,rssb involved,12,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"as you are familiar with the health system in rwanda, so which hospitals were involved how health sectors represented?",yeah actually start 13 hospitals selected levels referral hospitals provincial hospitals district hospitals actually like geographical representation certain level hospitals different areas country north west south east kigali city represented,13,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
who was leading the negotiation on the side of government of rwanda?,steering committee steering committee chaired one government officials reporting course ministry actually one ministry activity involving mean three big institutions ministry finance ministry health rdb put place committee oversee activities steering committee chaired official rbc,14,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"if i understood you well, in technical assistant of chai they conducted the feasibility study, and abbott also conducted feasibility study, so were the two separate feasibility studies or one combined. so, can you expand a little bit more on this? ",abbott conducted actually try data base come proposal one separately joint activity access information know many tests much time take reagents delivered may come solution problems understand better one like baseline able provide offer later engagement signed ministry abbott feasibility study evaluated chai came facilitated coordination evaluation course evaluation joined minister health abbott chai rbc course make sure collect data impact brought new ppp,15,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
so how did the actors involved in this design process changed between the initial design and the final agreement so how it went on? ,yeah thank much question raised earlier knowing rssb involved part discussions rssb actually look way services rendered hospitals tie deliver minimum package official guiding list services prices need base level like provincial think district hospitals services done using abbott technologies part minimum package level means way prove efficiency service done like one one challenges made feasibility study really success specialist district hospital specialist cannot request certain lab test certain exam going paid insurance public insurance organization major challenge faced actually recent discussions machines moved issue minimum package tariff public hospitals yet revised make official include tests,16,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
did you bring these challenges on the table of negotiation?,yeah brought table discussed ministry something solve immediately takes time doesnt depend one institution takes involve social security rssb manages insurance solution come day two thats one options done move machines sites learn allowed carry tests example referral hospitals didnt face problem kind district think provincial well provincials dont full package services major challenge made us reverse look alternative way,17,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
so how did the actors involved in the design process change between the initial design and the final agreement?,actually question assumes final agreement reached yet,18,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"so, it is still under negotiation?",yes agreements done price services rendered abbott form agreement definitive public private partnership,19,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"but the actors who were in the negotiation team are still the same, or they have been changed? ",yeah took longer took long longer planned challengessome people moving course turnover every institution terms institutions representation institution withdrawn removed process individuals moving something happens continuously organization teams changed many people moved away used like chair steering committee longer many changes took place,20,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
how did this change affected the process and the progress?,yeah also many big kinds strong factor came place think may lead us believe factors factors couldnt observe effect since theyre ones theyre alone example covid activities stopped people tend believe everything happened happen due covid probably absence people would impact cant account since covid everyone covid wouldnt allow progress big animal see covid seeing people moving affecting progress activities,21,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
so how covid-19 affected the process? ,yes especially evaluation evaluation feasibility study,22,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"so, in this interval have there been any champions supporting the ppp?",got separate individuals institutions course champions people presenting respective institutions process theyre ones champion ppp,23,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
have there been any actor trying to propose opposite direction from the main actors working in the ppp? ,actors proposing reverse change anything,24,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"so, who or which institution have been ultimately responsible for approving the ppp design? ",actually one institution responsibility done jointly different sectors well rdb minister finance single institution would decide joint activity course phases approving process doesnt depend one institution aligned ministry sector ministry ministry health managing daytoday basis could resolve everything consulting submitting steering committee review rdb ministry finance per ppp law like procurement process single position person decide steps goes different hands ensure review transparency thats cannot say one like main major one one would influence separately,25,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"so, what option were or still being considered when designing the ppp model?",thank much may explain way understand first abbott proposed placement instruments different hospitals placement call reagent agreement plan whereby machine purchased customer placed manufacturer supplier business turn around purchase reagents actually maintenance guaranteed supplier thats still going abbott placed instruments instruments whereby tests done point care may say like chemistry hematology referral machine perform test facility installed tests required emergency immediately decision needs made patient,26,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"thank you very much. does abbott selected the health facilities, which it would want to operate in, or the health facilities were assigned by the government?",one cannot give exact answer agreed upon two parties dont know brought list first abbot wished go b c im sure would come choice may guided ministry came agreement operate 13 facilities,27,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
which criteria were based on to select the hospitals you are working in?,yes major criteria lets say geographical hospitals selected satellite labs across near borders see corners country represented another factor im certain may volume two parties find adequate sample prove concept needed adequate amount testimonial demonstrate efficiency viability business,28,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
how appropriate do you find the design of this model of abbott to the local context?,doesnt match exactly situation country adapted example bottoms observed things worked things move well example gave prices facilities prices tariff depends minimum package think government work come solution call minimum actually limit minimum least youre supposed maximum need provide service interpretation converted decision allow facilities submit bills extra services easy thing adapt model fine rwanda small bottoms addressedim sure perfect model come without need adapting adjusting yeah doesnt mean adapted rwanda,29,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"can you insist on that, elaborate a little bit more on that?",yeah actually ppp one supplier government pleasant suppliers also interested market one factor business side,30,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"so, thank you so much. what you would recommend as the process to have a buy-in for all stakeholders?",example im one decide propose think abbott contract government rwanda way stated ones supply actually manage labs thats statement cabinet resolution says would mean exclusive suppliers may market anymore still sustain services well good population going served side disruptive competition thats perception course many suppliers may think thats say case wanting rely one supplier maybe government decide combine make sure strong commitment supplier prevent potential interruption services,31,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
what would you recommend because you know in rwanda because you are familiar with the local context?,yeah thank much actually think able win buying stakeholders need make sure provide proposal model really meets care example biggest concern accessibility quality diagnostic services thats need bring table solution would solve pricing challenges theyre facing another market problem efficiency financial accessibility need adapt model problems context facing,32,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
what would be an ideal ppp design accommodate the needs of priority population?,yeah rwanda example terms geographical accessibility terms population size dont need multiply giant equipmentâ€™s facilities rather need create strengthen hubs see example population kigali thats beyond two 25 million dont need five seven big laboratories big equipmentâ€™s like two three sites specialized testing see remote facilities maybe place like 10 points care make sure least screening done referral done need confirmation rwanda dont need multiply big platform diagnostic platforms facilities except need immediate results clinicians,33,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"current design you are working with in abbott, is different from this ideal design you are talking about if you compare?",yeah actually think make sure levels groups population served ppp model would take account holistic healthcare delivery holistic means community level referral acute sophisticated care means deploying adequate appropriate resources depending level needs population course services bit centralized found specialized facility facilities equipment staff able utilize example community need lets say maternal child health primary healthcare delivered two groups doesnt require sophisticated equipment needs accessible near everyone community level example health post level,34,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"so, what would be necessary to get to the ppp closer to the ideal vision? so compared to your ideal model and what is being done, so what will be required to get closer to that?",yeah compare actually proposal abbott submitted government rwanda didnt consolidate solutions abbott example later ppp actually initiated abbot also brought support construction community mean community facilities called health post health post equipped small kits bundle tests needed community example incorporated package submitted ppp value impact would community general would greater deploying large sophisticated equipment course introduced part ppp discussed,35,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
thank you very much. so how has gender or social economic status or poor influenced the design of the ppp?,yeah actually abbott big institution many divisions thats whywhen talk rapid diagnostic separate division talk molecular separate division others diagnostic integration propose something country integration components make comprehensive holistic package covers needs course gap cannot covered one supplier would good wiser government look supplementary partnership doesnt mean partnering government need one supplier better rapid point care molecular example government contract particular package look another one another particular package look one supplier serve everything im sure get best everything yeah letâ€™s say put complete wear clothes dont buy house dont put brand brands shoes better one house suit look another onebut compulsory contract one supplier everything need map needs start tank head make sure every stage contract test area,36,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
so how would the ppp design address key consideration to improve access of laboratory diagnostics if ppp is proposed?,apart urban population population rwanda somehow homogenous point cannot say eastern part rwanda probably poor particular diseases need different prescription instrument service technologies services deployed every participating site take account differences assumed theyre major think gender social economy didnt influence much maybe type test part feasibility mean ppp talk maternal child health talking earlier probably taken account social economic lets say talking malaria diagnosis maybe geographical social economic status populations may influence type resources allocate tomay type diseases covered equipmentâ€™s ppp dont make significant difference terms populations different areas,37,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"what about the availability or the quality, efficiency and affordability of laboratory diagnostics in the ppp?",think apart fact allowed wouldnt reimbursed test ensure customers otherwise labs would benefit ppp equally particular challenge regards utilizing instruments following model adopted,38,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
thank you very much. so which consideration is the best served by the current design? if you compare what you have said and what is being offered by abbott? ,yeah laboratory diagnostic actually cost price dependent supplied purchased suppliers itâ€™s multifactorial parameter depends operational cost depends inputs resources put place facility level across chain actually terms efficiency think havent reached level start really seeing big impact utilize tests dont see significant impact cost volume increases benefit much efficiency yeah maybe havent reached level mathematically demonstrate operationally didnt reach level test volumes low,39,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"thank you. i was asking about among these consideration you are talking about, so which is currently receiving the least attention in the current design and the why?",example terms harmonization always challenges abbott proposing instrumentsso letâ€™s say hematology one type chemistry itâ€™s one type means youll get rid multiple brands multiple brands actually means multiple types reagents multiple contracts multiple everything harmonization catered actually since inspired challenge faced terms delivery reagents time abbott also solving issue delivering reagents cutting chain shortening chain supply chain long increases cost operational costs reaches facility really expensive also increases time delivery time abbott came approach delivering directly hospitals supply side harmonization actually solutions installed machines help visualize data remotely also solution helps managers oversee taking place facilities,40,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"thank you very much. so, what factors do you think changed the discussion around the ppp?",cant say something given attention every party hasnt come negotiation points stand terms every aspect informally hear people fearing monopoly let explain situation whereby rely one supplier people maybe tend believe one supplier case anything went wrong youll putting population risk one side people tend believe challenge well discussed cannot challenge yeah thats one things,41,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
can you elaborate little bit more about how covid 19 affected the ppp design?,hard tell actually factors let say ppp new health sector kind ppp something new anything new always unpredicted events maybe people dont immediately believe said believing new strategy business used operating multiple suppliers probably might affect way people perceive ppp new thing people tend fear reluctant getting maybe never know theyre sure going result,42,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"oh, thank you very much. so, if there is any technical support facilitating and financing for the ppp, how would the availability of this support affect the ppp design?",way affected way covid affected evaluation going evaluation feasibility study outcome pilot phase one continue attention paid covid response people testing people testing meetings would hold discuss outcomes site visits conducted activities delayed thats covid affected,43,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"that is very important. so, what are the features of the ppp design that would not be possible without this technical support?",think things well done start planning phase implementation results success prescribing model rely well thoroughly analyzed context content ppp technical support financial support provided understand context understand model put place terms agreement well started make sure viable cooperation two parties thats intervention much needed benefit quick implementation part analysis understanding content example challenge related test done theyre tariff seen maybe timely decision would made would made challenges resulted one wouldnt faced think support needed heavily start conception phase make sure rest phases running smoothly without challenge,44,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"how would you recommend that technical support being used to address any gap, existing gap, all weaknesses capacity among key stakeholders?",first done engagement implementation placement instruments solutions result parties convinced thing doable profitable fact proposal initial also makes sense every party convincing step following stages theme planning proposal phase well established likely ppp phases engagement implementation going done successfully,45,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"so, the following questions is about, the policy context and the historical relationship that influence over the ppp. so, the question is how supportive is the existing policy legal and the regulatory framework for ppp?",think support addressed government suppliers respond partnership actually theyll come filling cops providing services requested government better government able understand needs government vision knows want take population quality services want achieve 50 years supplier come tell solution problems sometimes mislead oh give dont really need maybe need today years wont serving population way want support allocated governments clearly analysis assessment needs projection kind services need future come requirements service provider come,46,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
so how much resistance among policy makers will these ppp need to overcome to garner the necessary support?,yeah case rwanda since rwanda already ppp law place organs enforce policy law actually place active papers something practice means proposal came clear interpretation orientation procedures need followed per law presence law place something law really clear related something related clearly stated uh public private partnership presence law indicates processes procedures follow committees formed process step step proposal sign agreement definitive agreement really guided confusion,47,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
how flexible is the ppp to changes in the government or government priorities?,see actually anything new approaches new theyre introduced first time course people certain comfort multiple suppliers multiple options may reluctant opting one certain service resistance cannot overlooked overcome way potential show reasons resistance unanswered questions answered upfront establishing project proposal ppp cause proposal able answer potential questions raised many actors people would need buy idea details processes start end well clearly defined everyone would find answers questions would raising,48,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
how flexible the ppp should be in the case of these priorities change?,think depends started view ppp come based needs government example government needs offer certain services population government doesnt means resources operate solely needs partner private organizations case least even dont means provide services alone least know minimum requirement defining problems clearly solutions problems look like know solutions looking easy attract anyone know theyre going stretch youre looking farm want offer population means place yeah think thats emphasis need put,49,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"yeah. so, if tomorrow we need to establish a ppp another kind of ppp so what kind of experience or lessons that you may suggest to pay attention with to have the success?",provided agreement example agreed going certain project together organization later find different facts redirect intervention implementation stipulated agreements course agreement shouldnt written stone ways amending agreements go along implementation stated agreement lets say monitoring mechanism seeing things evolve adapting context situation thats way ppp flexible ppp something already meant agreement going make depending envisioned together two parties agree,50,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
what are the similarities or differences between the approach of ahdp and abbott or roche?,thank much actually first thing engaging stakeholders exclude later would see would consulted stakeholder example health sector need finance need healthcare insurance need hospitals us make informed decision need involve start let understand envisage details yeah part really crucial help implementation many resistance,51,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
how trusting collaborative is the relationship between the public private sectors for health?,well think ahdp like mechanism facilitating countries acquire agreements like abbott roche read properly like initiative going help developing countries acquire enter agreement terms roche abbott theyre similar terms nature public health organizations actually scope operation terms product lines difference depended heavily performance otherwise equipment technologies many similarities one stronger aspect another one stronger aspect previous version may good tomorrow better version keep um competing everyone something presents advantage,52,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
how has historical relationship between the public and the private sector for health influenced the current ppp arrangement?,think apart even health sector rwanda government service providers private operators think lot trust trust level trust really high actually reason fact behind example supply good services government youre quite sure ill paid really something precious rwanda supplier supply request pay upfront doesnt trust youll pay later something really increases trust level trust governmental private organizations second maybe government also trust private organizations way ensure assert trust maintained high,53,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"thank you very much. so, what has been the historic investment and interest from government in laboratory diagnostic? ",example experience procurement entity rwanda worked central medical supply rms procurement apart suppliers used request advanced payment factors lack trust almost suppliers happy sign contract send suppliers wait paid later secondly public institutions eprocurement really demonstrated transparency much clearer based attest level trust based experience suppliers send products feel comfortable really profound,54,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
so how does the improvement in the laboratory diagnostics align with the government priorities for the health sector?,yeah first infrastructure laboratory really upgraded past used small room corner even equipment wouldnt place install almost hospitals labs upgraded certain really higher standard level terms infrastructure course government collaboration partners overall coordination prioritization done government terms capacity building also investment government trained many lab scientists really increased diagnostic capacity laboratories terms equipment many equipmentâ€™s procured others placed leasing,55,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
what is the profile of health workers relative to diagnostic system including training and cadres?,actually aiming universal healthcare cant talk healthcare without diagnosis actually medical decision laboratory relied provide results guide clinical decisions governments aim ensuring quality healthcare laboratory played really investments terms acquiring equipment training people expanding laboratory buildings building new ones helped laboratories meet increasing demand testing cause increase access means increase number tests increase number tests rooms testers increasing way meet target fact labs increased terms infrastructure equipment personnel helping meeting target ensuring universal health care,56,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"so, who are the key stakeholders in the public private partnership and why are they involved?",ive opportunities visiting remote health centers think recent think three years health centers could notice laboratorians really trained laboratorians people studies needed people place train someone didnt lab secondary make lab technician see terms human resource still scars still discuss maybe hospital level leastprofessionals trained even hospitals claim havelimited budget hire given volume work least level hospitals urban areas adequate staffing butremote health centers still suffering maybe professionals university studies cannot go far given budget pay remote areas conditions life standard want probably affecting remote health facilities generally terms human resource laboratory services level really considerably good,57,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
what would be the important of global partnership or funders?,starting health sector ministry health supposed line ministry sets policies see implementation rbc implementation arm government terms health presence really relevant compulsory terms ppp looking ministry finance comes partnerships involves budget generation revenue generation income side government entails expenditures expenditures done ministry finance apart role planning also say terms expenses revenues ministry finance really relevant stakeholder terms ppp sector actually rppa dont know mentioned acquisition means procurement purchasing something r ppa regulatory body procurement processes government organizations rwanda development board one charge business developmentbe purely private theyre ones provide environment register businesses partnership government theyre also involved kind regulate business development terms ofprivate public partnershiprwanda medical supply responsibility procure commodities procurement going done different mechanism need involved resourceful terms knowing workflow flow commodities challenges realities field need part channel partnership need also involved ppp may later participate implementation need part bigger forum make sure provide input theyre experts terms supplies medical products theyre ones feel challenges needs customer terms supply,58,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"so, thank you for considering this list of stakeholders so how do they perceive the advantages and the disadvantages of the ppp?",yeah funders operate many countries access data access foreign experiences one thing second stake theyre also funding youvalue funding youll involve decisions going funded money theyre like uh partners development partners government theres way leave aside starting something call help finance addition experience whole budget youll need future need expertise many countries see concept done elsewhere successful,59,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
what would be their incentives to participate in ppp?,yeah think perspective vary depending institution example sector judgment perception going totally different cost benefits ministry health rbc oversee technical aspects clinical benefits think budget side look profitability health sector look especially doesnt mean dont look side theyre focused concerned clinical outcomes technical benefits partnership depends really institution area expertise insurance companies maybe may promote something increases cost also increases quality services technical clinical organization insurance see extra expense theyll perceive differently perception defers depending seat,60,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
how interested are the private partners in participating in ppp?,think actually law participate role play part work anything comes related ppp says youll involved rdb ministry finance line ministry sector motivation addition mandate institution solving problem solved government means one would attract found partner going fund provide inputs investments particular problem couldnt afford means going solved motivation behind organization get involved ppp actually problem solving,61,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"so, what are private partnerâ€™s main questions around participating in the ppp? ",lets say test done private lab done public think provided quality service rendered customer patient really maintained otherwise rules even labs private dont think government point competing private sector provided patient peace think loss maybe done public private labs maybe losing business done private since government competing much private businesses think major thing customer served sure fact tests done public probably private labs may benefit set businesses make money test done away means opportunity youre getting,62,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
what are the biggest incentives for private partners to participate in the ppp in country?,think ppp concept yet clear everyone means even managers big farms dont perceive way go generally probably time approached probably discussed maybe get much interested traditional way business biotech sector making sure place instrument purchase reagents core business core mission ppp dont think many companies started thinking though way winwin situation sell governments also benefit im sure think interest yet high,63,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
okay so what are the biggest drawbacks for private partners to participate in the ppp? ,major concern volume testing volume need see return many reagents purchased major concern wasnt sufficient areas like said tariffs tests affected volumes high,64,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
do you think that private partners working in laboratory diagnostics in rwanda have the capacity to participate and deliver on the ppp. why and why not? ,gain biggest proportion market share,65,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"are you aware of the financial instruments that ahdp is offering? if so, what are they? ",first thing think reference else successful sure things going work actually given process rwanda took bit longer expected somehow discouraging written earlier something done six one year still done didnt go fast projections done know commercial organizations projections sales every year dont meet target yeah already loss fact things dont move pace expected really somehow discouraging,66,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
do you think that these financial instrument from ahdp sufficient to incentivize the private sector engagement in the ppp? why and why not?,answer yes yes product lines produce put machines solutions agreement dont manufacture everything means enter agreement lab good scope limited offer remaining part sourced elsewhere know part response based actually one manufacture everything even manufacture everything doesnt mean best everything,67,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
are private partners interested in taking up the available financial instrument offered by ahdp? why and why not? ,rough estimate saw onthe page read budget 125 million dollars think itâ€™s worksum may divided different costs probably dedicated fully equipment also oversight management everything dont think directly purchase equipment uh think divided portions saw figure okay 76 million 125 million dollars think yeah,68,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
what are or could be the plans in the place to support public sector financing of diagnostics in the future? ,think give opinion money shouldnt purchase equipment money put place clarity needed country participating best optimal model suitable country studies really defining model type model suitable country thats investment needs go otherwise private private organizations even elsewhere even europe dont sell price course customers buy place instrument shouldnt allocated buying equipmentâ€™s probably conducting studies providing evidences facilitating sessions establishing ppp models yeah oversight actually informing right decision make wrong countries may need infrastructure upgrades may need countries countries may budget infrastructure upgrades somewhere,69,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
is there anything else you would like to discuss about ppp that we have not talked about? ,depends sold idea cause private companies interest selling primary objective selling course theyre called public health organization saving lives mission first indicator theyre job sell proposal idea theyre seeing theyre going make sells possible given ahdp strong voice looking behalf many countries nothing partner discuss cause talking five countries large population actually kind pulled procurement pulled procurement like taking five countries bringing volumes together suppliers see theyre interested think say im coming im also able im also interested telling win market five countries really attractive,70,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"thank you very much for your willingness to participate. i have taken you really a very good time for your day. and, as i stated at the beginning, if the ppp move ahead to contracting, we will conduct a second round of interview. and if you agree, we may reach out again in the next few months to schedule another interview with you to see what to capture the new perspective, according to the development. thank you very much.

"and what about the management and finance and aslo the capacity, because when you started ppp you had also to ensure that you have the capacity in your institution. what do you think about that?",well dont know specifically answer lab diagnostic would probably give advantages disadvantages guess pursuing ppp really advantagesyou ability share risk partnersso thats public private usually risk allocated party equipped best equipped handle deal could financial risk technical risk whichever advantage share risk purposes project also ability rely private sector financing also relieves public sector know spending much certain key areas health educational housing whichever could allows public sector free bit budget depending contribution towards ppp also said ability ppp long term youre able even plan futuristically community society truly provide comfort knowing taking necessary steps beginning youve procured best person negotiated solid contract going govern asset resource quite long period time know need project benefit community years come,44,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9

",think supportive initiatives made ensure first legal framework date actually business needs society also provided different categories ppps used structured really provides clarity partners would say legal framework supportive relevant looks different scenarios highlighted key sectors economy instrumental helping people facilitating even better service delivery country,45,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
and the next question something that have a legal background so how supportive is the existing policy legal and regulatory framework for ppps.,think lot resistance beginning especially new law policy introduced definitely reservation choosing use structured mean going current steps provided law people thought lengthy thought would really take lot time might even maybe push away private sector thought people lose interest see extensive process,46,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
so based on your experience how much resistance do you see among policymakers to ppp?,im sorry maybe dont understand question flexible mean change another model,47,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
and how flexible is the ppp to changes for example in government priorities.,may bit tricky especially said taken right processes according law may bit difficult might terminate start afresh choose another option parties decided,48,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"yes, yes",say different model mean financial model instance decided build transfer ppp instance want change maybe joint venture kind change youre talking,49,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"okay, so if we want to change something in the ppp, because we came up with a model and then we realized that maybe we should refine it and changes to a certain different type of model. so that means that will need to terminate it first? ",okay important thing clear youre calling ppp youre calling privatization youre calling sale careful mix terms law clearly provides categories contracts niche agreements would fall ppp think four five double check theres build operate thatâ€™s may government allows build asset allows operate build transfer end specific term asset sent transferred back governmentwe management agreements well lease operate develop government lease asset operate develop point yeah bring something like privatization strict sense means youre relinquishing ownership rights asset youre giving away completely private sector forever youre going come back say know give back asset theyve paid private sector owner privatization thats completely different ppp,50,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"all changes especially here for the lab diagnostics so they have different models so some models where they were proposing for example, co-management between the government and the private partner, and the model all where we will just decideto go for privatization.",case co management know wouldnâ€™t go ppp process provided law think thats something either hospital moh rbc maybe put tender looking comanagers get pool interested people select get separate co management agreements would pretty much take ordinary contract arrangement opposed ppp thats detailed go feasibility study process clearance sort thing coming back question change would make sense lease operate develop example beginning thats parties agreed negotiated,51,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"i read the document and looking at the description and characteristics, it looked like the new that one the lease operate and develop. give the lab sector, the lab network to a private partner that has expertise in how to manage these labs. the different labs that we have in the country. and that question that company that private partner will operate these labs but also develop for a certain period of time.was co-management so that the government will have some responsibilities with, and the private partner also will have some responsibilities.",havent seen parties switch nature contracts especially ppps theyve really taken lot time negotiate beginning really tried factor risks know possible mishaps know many things gone process bit hard tell someone change havent seen practice time,52,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"all the other way around coming from the management, this lease, operate and develop, so you have never seen that.",havent seen many ppps health theres one hoping take effect still feasibility study stage looks promising taken quite long time developing feasibility study went process provided law expected feasibility study done approved contracting authority submitted steering committee progresses contract negotiationbut rest contracts seen health know theyre outside ppp format youll management service contracts know public sector private partner,53,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"historically, how the public and the private sectors are focusing on health, how have they interacted in the past years?",mean private public,54,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"and the collaboration between two partners how do you find it? is this like they trust really each other, does the relationship really smooth between the two partners.",think theres lot good faith parties theres lot collaboration think area partners willing explore willing get business think good think positive,55,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"yes, the private and the public sector, especially in health.",either one ive seen youre talking ppp according law clarity,56,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"so, you said something that i want us to better understand you said that the most of the contracts for the health sector are out of the ppp.",well maybe also reading current law called implementation law number 142016 second may 2016 governing public private partnerships passed 2016 2017 believe let pull exact definition may clear get go,57,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"okay. so, can you tell me according to the law, what is a ppp, just for me to better understand?",seen yet idea,58,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"thank you, this makes things more clearly.",havent dealt particularly speculate would assume thats something negotiate agree management workthats think,59,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"yeah. the next question is, how health system governance arrangements affect the design of the ppp, you know, i think it's also applicable to the administrative governance that then the governance in general that we have in rwanda,",yes would advise,60,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"especially if you are implementing the ppp and you have this different level of decisions. who is going to be held accountable if it's a ppp that is going to be implemented at the lower level, and you have these two layers of decisions?",dont know answer,61,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"yeah. so, meaning that one when you are working on the ppp this is something that you should plan ahead and negotiate and set it clear.",,62,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
next question is asking. maybe you may not have much information about that. but we are looking at investments and interest from the government in lab diagnostic.,really varies forestry agriculture tourism ict energy mining mention,63,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"so you've been working in different sector except from the ppp that you were just mentioning that is currently ongoing, have you worked on any other ppp in the health sector before?",havent seen many people health sector genuinely theone hoping materializedbut said thefeasibility study stage,64,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
so you've been working mainly in which sector.,sometimes still negotiate wont go instance ppp steering committee likely feasibility studies done pertinent ppp project must feasibility study,65,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"is this because there are few people in health sector or, because maybe by chance you just don't work in health.",align ministry ministry health might want ministry finance case budgetary financial contribution guess dont know else ministry health technical parties would good well maybe rbc well depending objective,66,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"okay, interesting. but then, all the service contracting,so that means that this doesn't go through rdb, no.",would depend project objective,67,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"so, okay then for a ppp who are the stakeholders that should be involved, when you're developing a ppp. let's say we have this ppp in health, what are the key stakeholders that should be involved.",im sure think would decision centralized level decide would need purposes developing ppp discussion,68,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
no any other like government institution?,mean driving ppp mean process actual implementation project,69,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"so yeah, and do you have for example this one was around laboratory diagnostics. so what about the health facilities should they be also involved in developing the ppp",think would really depend ministry would lead technical part would come district dont know whoever feel necessary purposes project might instrumental reviewing feasibility study findings develop private partner give feedback think maybe crucial role play definitely provide technical input contract negotiation,70,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"but then, when we look at these key stakeholders. what is their influence in driving the ppp?",come point contract negotiation thats also provided another look role,71,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"the process, because we are still at this phase of the process. so especially when they are designing the ppp and when it comes to negotiations.",lead negotiations help draft conduct meetings review take project documents internal approval processes ensure parties concerns catered try get best positions party ensure thatâ€™s reflected document,72,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"and what about rdb you didn't list, actually it's now, rdb before the key stakeholders, when you're developing the ppp shouldn't rdb be there?",think would defer investment court sure benefits provided generally incentive would enticing investors sector generalyou corporate income tax holidays immigration incentives might also input duty incentives permitted certain incentive importing equipment certain amount think things would drive private sector interest thats government done create favorable investment climate particular reasons would defer investment court definitely think research definitely look incentives dedicated health sector get idea would drive private sector involvement,73,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"and doing now, contract negotiation. what is your role?",think drawbacks iâ€™m speculating im sure,74,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"and then, so how based on your experience with other ppp how interested are private partners to participate in the ppp. for instance what are their incentives to participate, what are their drawbacks?",think health sensitive sector think one predominantly historically led governments people centric careful manage service know things like education health almost put category theyre particular handled think know bit may reservation bit know sectors also evolving time telemedicine coming many innovations health sector coming well another thing government done also move times ensure facilitating innovations thats im saying look incentives know theyâ€™re really encouraging innovators investors health sector various sectors drawbacks would pick sensitivity sector may create level drawbacks know people getting creative every day,75,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
and then what are the drawbacks?,would based findings feasibility study inform design itthats would say depends findings financial technical viability looks like look partiesâ€™ strength decide format law would make sense,76,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
there is no problem it's based on what you learned.,think would informed still feasibility study show viable project youll able determine sustain itdo need take loan going finance enough equity know things youre going look kind equipment youre using management costs related something sustain think feasibility study take good time develop informs might bring information implement project correctly sustainable manner,77,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
this is the last question for you. how the ppp could be designed to achieve scale up and sustainability.,thank,78,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"and then for sustainability when we go for ppp we want something that will actually address the challenges the issues that we have in whatever systems we're working with, if someone wanted to get working on a ppp in whatever sector. so what would you advise especially for the sustainability component? what should we look at? ",go back little bit actually going ask spoken dm nrl,79,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"so, this is the last one, but this is for you actually so if there is anything that you would like to add on what we have discussed.",yeah actually first time participate anything ahdp course ppp projects abbott others participated first time ahdp think im right person donâ€™t know,80,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"thank you for your time. and we're very glad that you've been able to find some time to discuss with us. and this will help this evaluation, and it will be really helpful for us to understand better the ppp process and ppp implementation at the country level, that will help also this evaluation that we are doing for the ahdp project.",okay,81,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
so the first question that we have for you is to ask you to describe your involvement in this ppp process for the ahdp. at what point where you involved?and what were you doing? what was your role?,think know assessment done,1,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
division manager?,understand,2,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"so, we talked with the division manager, we had also plan to talk with the former head of department of biomedical services.",okay understand right may go ahead,3,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"so, the ahdp, maybe i can give you more details in 2019 i think chai was the technical assistance for that particular ppp. so this was a ppp that was supposed to be financed through the european investment bank, they had some funds for that and then, chai was providing technical support, they worked with the nrl team, and as well as the ministry of health team.first of all, they did some assessment of the situation at that time, to see what the challenges that we have are in the lab diagnostic system.",like said years back 20182019 gap seen lab networks assess available resources distribute equally optimize improve services laboratories across hospitalsso remember first time involved preparation technical documents need assessment invited meeting provide biomedical engineers support program someone assigned person participated whether site visits hospitals collection data development reports moved forward also participated workshop approve validate final proposals outcome surveys think involvement process,4,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"from there they did, i think a feasibility study where they came up with the different options for the ppp that went from, i think sample transportation, then they started with something like co-management, privatization,they had a lot of discussions around that. so, the questions that we have here ask your involvement. this will depend on your involvement actually in the process. ",know rubavu would check,5,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"so then to clarify that it would be interesting for you to explain to us what your real role at what were you involved? what did you do exactly?did you have like a specific role at the forefront, or were you more like at the back, something like that. yeah.",one happened kigali may hotel remembering name exactly itâ€™s also validation,6,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"okay, so can you describe your involvement in this ppp process.",yes thats case think rubavu one nsp wasnt laboratory national strategic plan,7,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
and can you remember when this workshop happened?,think got many think correct answer,8,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"was it last year, or 2020? and you were talking about the workshop where you were invited for the validation of the findings in rubavu.",yes assigned biomedical engineer charge laboratory equipment management person participated process well,9,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"okay, and actually chai was the one leading, organizing and presenting the results of what they did.",yes engineeryeah currently still position,10,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
the rubavu one?,yeah sure feel free,11,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"okay. so, you told me also that someone from your department was involved in working with the team when they were working on the needs assessment, right? ",dont think provide much details really involved ppp negotiationswhat know process usually goes rdb depends terms depends responsibilities party really didnt participate actively development ppp,12,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
is he still working with rbc?,much,13,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"okay, maybe we'll reach out to him also.",findings thats correct,14,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"thank you. so, the next question we want to better understand how the process of negotiation of the ppp. how did it go? if you can describe how the process was undertaken.",assessment yeah findings need assessment proposal redistribution ensure optimized service delivery didnt go next steps,15,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"and then, if we talk about now the different models that came out of, you know they did the feasibility study presented at the end, some models. so were you involved during the discussion around these models which one should we, for example, implement versus another? did you participate in such meetings?",mostly identifying different systems one system installed used optimally whether services needed another hospital health facility could use system identify placements proposed redistribution equally,16,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
so the one you went at that hotel was just validation of the findings.,dont think thats asking spoke dm would much informed otherwise didnt really follow validation,17,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
findings of the need assessment? ,technical part participate even engineer mentioned,18,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
okay. and what if you don't know if you still remember these propositions of redistribution. what did they exactly presented ? ,share contacts maybe also tell,19,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"yeah, the equipment that were available in the system. you said that you didn't participate in the discussion around the selection of the model to implement especially when they were discussing the ppp design because we wanted to know, how it happened during the discussion and what were the sticking points you know those points where people are discussing a lot, and not agreeing?",really,20,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"what were those points and then how were they resolved. if you didn't participate, then it's going to be difficult to answer that. but i think you are aware of what was going on and i would like to know if you knew the institution or individuals involved in the design of the ppp.",really,21,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"oh, okay. actually, we talked to him but we wanted to talk to as many people as possible to gather more information.so then, after the meeting that you attended for the needs assessment for the rest of the activity who was involved, or even for him he wasn't involved in the discussions, especially on the design of the ppp.",except documents shared hadnt heard ahdp,22,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
okay,well itâ€™s difficult question broad think ppp possible lab diagnostics especially providing specific equipment manufacturer provide machine pay test reagents procured theres another way outsource tests supposed done lab outsourcing mobile lets say quick people quickly intervene serve population even find patients home instead moving hospital lab know possible done countries well established laboratories government outsource testing even high containment requirements testing could interesting see rwanda definitely solve issues exist currently,23,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"you said that your involvement was at the beginning, when you had to provide technical details and then to help in the needs assessment. so, i was asking when the feasibility study was available with the different ppp designs or models that were proposed, were you not involved or attended in any meeting where they presented these designs?",imagine,24,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
we see then you haven't heard about anything about a ppp for the lab network. i was actually looking at the questions that we have based on your feedback.,somehow address important issues availing reagents time also plan together payment ahead time bit limiting well case dont perform well delay always wait person handle tests also choose perform well limit expertise think case promised services provided written contracts pros cons ppp exists already would say comparing nonppp contracts equipment far better currently ppp far better depend buy equipment one one,25,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"you didn't have any information about this ahdp-ppp. so nothing about, no discussion around the co-management that they proposed at some points or about the privatization.",extent yes beginning management contract also renewal,26,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"okay. so let's then keep it in general, based on your knowledge of the lab network that we have and then as a biomedical engineer, you know, so the equipment that we have, would you thinkfor example how should an ideal ppp accommodate the needs of priority population for example if we have to designa pppfor public private partnership in lab diagnostic, how should it be designed so that we accommodate the needs of our priority population like the poorest households , andpeople with very complicated diseases.",first one maybe ensure terms beneficial sides equally signature one must ensure services offered continuously quality quantity safe manner also saw less capacity building ppp system would definitely focus capacity building hospitals benefit supplier client terms someone small repairs preventive maintenance troubleshooting services delayed stopped supplier would still keep important difficult services handle would say would look terms carefully benefit parties especially people field,27,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"so, it's very difficult when iâ€™m looking at keeping it general not going into this ahdp-ppp ",would say important patient beneficiary theyre ones receive services services best get time also providing full information would also think hospitals clinicians good network good machine full best options operational advantage much important network,28,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"yeah, when you look at the ppp that we have currently let's use the ppp that we have currently in place in rwanda. do you think that they address the real needs of the people, and if no, what are the areas that we can improve and how can we improve those areas?",would say wish benefit patient still ones benefits time satisfy clients ppp solving problem terms quality terms time servicesbut consider contractor partner consider government partner think stake ensure provide services satisfaction party,29,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"and then, were you involved in other ppp for example the ppp with abbott",institution,30,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"and then, what can we learn from this experience? what are the main lessons that you learned from or still learning even from this ppp?",depends point view coming im speak government employee would say depend benefits government gettingand case think one threatened added value people government improvements reducing investments done irregularly problem giving full services want solve problems delay,31,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"when you do a ppp like this, were there key stakeholders and why were they involved?",yeah rwanda lots companies think 10 supplying lab equipmentbut 10,32,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"so, the next question is about we are looking, we want to know who benefits the most when there is public-private partnership lab diagnostic who do you think benefit the most?",yeah different types equipment lab equipment,33,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"yeah, i was asking this question because the next one is really to try to understand is there anyone or any institution that can be threatened by the fact that the government is going into partnership with a private actor in the lab diagnostics? ",mostly lab see ppp happening big equipment require lot reagents ones often used ones accept ppp kind contracts also portfolio required smaller companies smaller firms dont like wait prefer sell leave mostly big equipment require lot reagents backed important portfolio,34,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
yes,incentives two kinds incentives one maybe details one provided rdb company coming invest rwanda important portfolio incentives taxes investment canâ€™t give details dont know us rbc nrl mostly provide support need might provide space install machines even way work different possibilities discussed one comes mind availability infrastructure space work fromand course planned together gave support technically need,35,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"okay. do we have many suppliers of lab equipment? apart from abbott, and roche, do we have others?",think know government rwanda works different development partners budgets provided world bank global fund cdc think going continue point course cant attest continuing make inquiries contact new development partners wouldnt say final list main ones,36,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
they are more than 10?,know national laboratories presently improving services able monetize services well privatized get incomeso thats one way increase funds used lab also local partners potential partners available saw covid lot rwandan companies responded call support technically financially provided donations also partnership good see potential well local companies local institutions also course nrl activities,37,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"and the next question is about private partners, and if there is a ppp so how interested are private partners in participating in ppp, we want to understand what the main questions are when it comes to participating in the ppp. so what are the biggest incentives to participate in the ppp, and on the other hand what are the drawbacks for them?",maybe one example covid19 testing services theyâ€™re generating income,38,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
when you say important portfolio what do you mean exactly? ,really want thank involving would happy answer follow question,39,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"that can be able to recruit local representative after installation those that can even bring reagents in advance and be ready to supply at a moment notice, and contracting with the government means that there will be emergencies. let's say if there's an estimation of the quantity that is needed, there will be always surplus or less. so, someone who was able to be flexible and is not threatened by small limitations or small challenges and can be able to have trained technicians who are ready to support technically for the maintenance repairs and everything at a moment notice. and also, most of them do not have replacement equipment, they can't afford to have equipment to supply once one is broken.",thank dr involvement ppp project firstly sector level ministry health partners dealing public private partnership projects usual sectors diagnostic better improving quality service laboratory thought also public private partnership improved care involvement project lead coordinating teams project ministry health partners rbc also rdb ive coordinating work day right feasibility study showed us areas improvement quality service delivered laboratories currently need ppp model role coordination role ministry level,40,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"so, yeah, that's interesting. so what you have listed may be considered as drawbacks for some of the potential private partners that wants to engage in ppp.but then what are the incentives for them to come and work with you as the government what will motivate them, what are the different factors that can motivate them to participate?",said first problem statement going ppp issue improving quality care delivery services laboratories public hospitals line also national reference lab happened years back realizing inefficiencies issues deliver quality care testing result delivery good time leaders thought improve decide feasibility study support obviously different partners rdb want bring public private partnership involve rdb talk minister wanted improve quickly feasibility study see would call like situation analysis done improve done know quality care achieved feasibility study showed different six issues laboratory facing hospitalsi cannot remember tell one delayed results delivery samples taken patientsampling site diagnosis made results delivery good one six recommendations let us improve sample transportation delivery results time another one also improve management could make money also capacity staff know sit back say okay faced cannot take six recommendations go go first pressing country maybe laboratories say lets first deal sample transportation would start piloting phase ppp see produce negotiation around first implementation recommendations feasibility study phase one sample transportation ppp thats negotiation started start start piloting six months implementing sample transportation would transition full comanagement full ppp managing whole laboratory services plan actually results assessment first ppp negotiation thats,41,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"what are, or, could be the plans in place to support public sector financing of diagnostic? so, for example, we have different sources of funding in rwanda for the health sector, what are these sources of funding that are expected to be used for financing the lab diagnostic? so now we have some source of funding but in the future, are we thinking about other source of funding?",yes yes sample transportation,42,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"yeah, and then locally, if you think about domestic resources, they need plan on how to leverage on these domestic resources to increase funding for lab diagnostic to support just like lab diagnostic in the future?",second would full comanagement like lab comanagement like private person would take staff hiringfiring new equipment supply chain would transitioned private partner even though would transitioned full comanagement still moh rbc would oversight coordination actually partner taking,43,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10

"okay, so we tried to give the conversation, broad on ppp in general because based on your feedback you were not involved in the ahdp- ppp design process. ",say let start facility selection like project look like let focus first phase talked partial organized sample facilities explain address question facilities selected first looked facilities different hospitals health centers different provinces country according geographical distribution select made us choose hospitals looked first volume volume samples get hospitals secondly catchment area nearby laboratory struggling specialty laboratories lab tests done,45,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
and so is there anything else you would like to discuss or add to this discussion on public private partnership in the lab that we did not discuss but you think that this is something important that we should know.,yes actually criteria selected satellite labs way project designed could satellites labs like call sampling sites think like hubs lab samples brought satellite siteshubs collected hubs tested results given back samples wouldnt tested satellite labs theyre transported national lab selected like used hubs provinces criteria number two catchment area talked attached every hospital considered catchment areas surrounding health centers within hospital think around 59 centers six hospitals dont remember numbers well dont numbers sorry hospitals must catchment area thatâ€™s health center also considered,46,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10

"that's very good. oh okay, what were the sticking points around the ppp design, and how were well they resolved.",yeah proposed started engaging policy level involve everyone call innovative way ppp another way addressing issues came rbc,10,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"for the investment done in the lab, especially were caused by covid-19. so, what was the key point, was it like to see what will happen with this investment?",actually course negotiations discussions came improve public laboratories without involving ppp worried separate hospitals laboratory worry,11,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"thank you very much. thatâ€™s was very informative. so, who has been involved in the initial design of the ppp?",yeah think means learn improved come learn,12,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"what about minecofin,",rbc side worried hospitals yet engaged never engage policy level yet agreed model,13,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
what about the health insurance.,steering committee ppps go steering committee country level composed rdb moh minecofin ppp initiatives approved steering committee,14,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"okay! you said that the chai was helping in the technical aspect, especially for feasibility study.but also, the chai was as the ministry of health development partner. on the other hand, biding for these ppp. so, having this kind of financial aspect. what do you think about that?can you elaborate a little bit of this aspect of market? ",people international dont know check know,15,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
yeah. thank you very much so.,institutional level,16,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"if i understand well, the cutoff point was investment done during the covid-19 ",think ive repeating options wanted like operate five years transfer back laboratory government public ownership im familiar terms kind management hands private partner five years five years transfer back facility laboratories government rwanda dont know call ive seeing terms thats whats option proposed,17,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"so, have there been any champions, supporting the ppp? who has been championing the ppp in rwanda?",yeah sure,18,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"i do understand the rdb is championing all ppp because itâ€™s their mandate. but, regarding ppp in laboratories, who is the champion who brought the idea to the table to be discussed, did this come from rbc?",yes,19,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"have there been any other actors, trying to propose the opposite direction from the main actors working in the ppp.",yes thatâ€™s project built,20,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"and in india and kenya again, i think there were good results.",sort complicated complicated appropriateness comes country local context want rwandaâ€™s case good way already wanted proposed thatâ€™s went feasibility study think africa diagnostic health platform mandate work local context ppp welcomed fitting need,21,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"these ideas to not separate lab from hospitals were they coming from the implementers such as the hospitals, or policy makers?",know rwanda ppp guideline already legal aspect think context welcomes ppp model,22,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
okay! thatâ€™s very good.,start poor like rightly mentioned people covered mutuelle cbhi ppp testsout specialty testwere supposed taken care already covered copayment would come categorization number three vulnerable poorest covered government rwanda subsidiaries covered meaning even ppp accommodate existing structure,23,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"so, which institution would have been ultimately responsible for approving the ppp design?",access number one key recommendations opted sample transportation phase one addressing access wanted timely access laboratory sampling testing already addressed ppp model,24,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"rdb, moh, minecofin",told coownership improve supply procurement supply affordability cost covered insurance negotiation insurance cbhi think ive addressed affordability availability two,25,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
i think there is minefra also,efficiency quality mentioned setting controls samples taken delivered lose samples way also addressed monitoring platform proposed centrally monitored rbc moh partner address quality efficiency actually needed timely costeffective model would changing status core seen inefficiencies wanted eliminate inefficiencies also design considered,26,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"what options were there? or, are still being considered on designing the model?",dont think already model started im confused think dont yet proposal,27,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"so, the contracting options are like so.",dual like supporting finance side would conflict interest actually expect professionalism looking want quality diagnostic services africa selected countries look living finance control nothing happen without finances also platform support technically advise technically independent looking worth would work best us effect positive way around push us see people declaring conflict interest dont know would work situation,28,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
if i understood wellthe private would have everything to manage,actually think straightforward case support ppp side ahdpso support would mean success ppp think would valuable ahdp supporting ppp come existence think facilitation positive ppp exist,29,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
and the government would oversee and then they transfer everything over five years.,look evaluation need evaluations point implementation would hard dont evaluator think would affected could platform supporting ppp also technical support facilitation along process ppp key experts,30,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"and how appropriate is the design of african health diagnostic platform the ppp to the local context,",thank firstly mentioned earlier last statement mentioned technical support know stakeholders project need capacity take lead ppp discussions also design im looking ahdp starting starting phase guidance support discussions also cannot come evaluation really supported project understand cant design evaluate also sort technical support needed along project design develop improved capacity stakeholders project thats view look technical support,31,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"so, at the levels of policy legal framework. there was one? was it fitting all these levels?",im clear maybe simplify,32,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"so how would an ideal ppp design accommodate the needs of a priority population such as broadest household? there are complicated patients for example the comorbidities, the chronic conditions, how the ideal ppp design addresses the special need of mutuelle about the poorest households, the 25% of households whose mutuelle is paid by government.",oh much support ppp actually allow private investment health terms domestic resource mobilization health discussions initiatives african leadership meeting domestic resource mobilization look ppp one way investing increasing private investment house country look policy regulation mentioned earlier also existing ppp guideline allowprivate public partnership models coming health sector,33,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"that's very good. so, would the ppp design address a key consideration to improve access of laboratory diagnostic? if ppp is proposed?",policymakers would like maintain quality give private deliver services delivering private partner position convince show model considers quality ahead things otherwise management modality negotiated dont think much resistance concern would maintain quality improve quality private person laboratory services,34,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"any elaboration on availability of test, the quality and efficiency also affordability in a ppp model?",one thing priorities government achieved different ways also ppp one ways like need improve quality need improve efficiency lab one priority find existing policies guidelines think would also fitting way address priority country,35,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
it was the quality and efficiency.,dont think many things might know tell abbottabbott laboratory one ppp models working may african health diagnostic platform learn learn ppp design implementation,36,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
so. which consideration is best served by the current design and why? ,really wasnt involved read read partly deeply reports implementation yeah never involved,37,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"so, now we move for the next question. the question is what were the factors that you think changed the discussion around the ppp that i think it was covered.",think trust good going increasing attracting private investors invest health cant attract someone dont trust control mechanism public put place know actually agreed implemented ground population protected think thats respond,38,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
if africa health diagnostic platform is providing the technical support. and the facilitating financing for this ppp. how would the availability of this support affect the ppp design? ,yeah thank actually would say investment heavy planning budgeting process laboratories planning purchase procure equipment consider training laboratory technicians trained deployed also consider supply consumables used lab think heavy investment side government,39,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"maybe you would understand this in this way ahdp come without any conflict of interest, because it's just facilitated the ahdp do not look ahdp as chai. just. these are the melinda gates. there are european investment bank, and they are bringing in money, and also providing some technical support for. they are not, beading they are facilitating, chai.",policy level moh key every day ppp addressing priority country rbc implementers also health providers hospitals key forget ministry finance economic planningand also rdb key stakeholder ppp also see partners health financing key stakeholders ppp model design discussions also implementation,40,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"so, the question is now how the availability of the support affect the ppp so, ppp would have an added value, and which one.",advantage number one address identified gaps laboratory disadvantage mentioned quality,41,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"so, what are the features of the ppp design that would not be possible without ahdp technical support?",want ambiguity wonder work well everything new people ask go convince existence project elsewhere results told tied individuals,42,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"so, what are the features of the ppp design that would not. how would you recommend african health diagnostic platforms, technical support being used to address any gaps?",addressing gap inefficiency timeliness also improve supply chain consumables functionality equipment technologies,43,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
now we move from the following set of discussion questions about the context of the ppp design. the next question would be how supportive is the existing policy legal and regulatory framework for the ppp.,incentives private investors rwanda many among first want invest favorable financially banks already without corporate income tax theres lot rdb sides investors interested health sector already incentive available workforce working company ppp project skilled clients need think investors would interested invest demandto realize return investment incentives investor detailed investments incentives rdb side,44,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"so, considering the existing policies and regulations, and existing framework. how are they supportive to the ppp design?",dont think threatening point projects individualized change position doesnâ€™t mean everything changed transfer skills knowledge also hand overs given changes position dont think threatening,45,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
so how much resistance among the policy makers will this ppp need to overcome?,agree,46,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"thank you very much. so, how flexible is the ppp to change according to changes in the government, or government priorities.",valid concern threats sluggish like lagging back lack information new person project moving someone changes every team team built still actors position onboard new leader new position person come doesnt hamper progress project working relationship ahdp ppp,47,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"yeah. so, what are other recent or earlier experience or a project to have there been in a country that you can provide the lessons for african health diagnostic platform. and that ppp that does exist in rwanda.",population delivering service population also government would priority deliver quality service thatâ€™s managed public private regardless provides services always population served,48,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
were you involved in this?,benefit ways want choose one depending design,49,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"so, how trusting collaborative, is the relationship between public and the private sector for the health.",perspective ill tell dont want decided look ppp looking solution address issue choose two opinion would improve publicly without involving private person beneficiary served cannot need investment private investment ok investor come work standard quality service government would want population well served thats opinion though itâ€™s exciting looking end results want achieve,50,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"well, thank you very much so. so, what has been the historic investment and interest from the government in the laboratory diagnostic? and what is profile of health workers, relative to the diagnostic system, including training, cadres",think winwin situation government wants improve care investor bringing money get return investment win win situation invested gained government achieved versus bringing investor areait must winwin situation,51,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"that's very good. yeah. so, who are the key stakeholders in the ppp and why are they involved?",think affects aligns dynamics county level coming area ppp already dont see effect align existing government guidelines instructions,52,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"how do they perceive, the advantage and disadvantage of the ppp.",know particular project didnt go think would interested already abbott private partners like lancet knowi think interest didnt reach stage,53,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"so, people do not want the ppp.",plans go back mentioned earlier along national planning priorities setting selections order improved access quality care testing vital testing diagnostics health care provision vital always considered planning phases ministry health taking care needed equipment infrastructure laboratories actually financed either government external refunding resource mobilization annually every yearâ€™s process itâ€™s sustainable tell funder take care diagnostic services country mentioned might government ordinary budget many external funding resource mobilization would ppp plans would considered national plans,54,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"yeah, and what are the advantages?",mentioned government external funding,55,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"that's good. so, what are the incentive to participate in the ppp? what would attract the private sector to invest in lab of the people?",really may sustainability government puts much percentage would say actually inverse government around 80 external 20 even maybe 10 cannot ensure sustainability rely external funding,56,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"so, how threatening to the success of the ppp is the potential for turnover in key position among national actors.",straight dont already cannot respond,57,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"yeah, i do understand, but today i may be discussing with someone, who understand things and tomorrow, i discuss it with the recent who may not understand.",oh specifically talking,58,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"and this is the reason of changing also the people, because the people are being changed for improvement like that. so, what do you say as that? as the health financing and the planning, policy.",oh donâ€™t think soi wouldnt talking happened specific project stopped dumped,59,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"thank you very much. so, whose interest, helped or hurt by the laboratory diagnostic happening in the public versus private sector.",thatâ€™s whatâ€™s said three years every year look needs must increase needed previous year think maybe like 20 increase thats across whole priorities budgeted,60,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"the population is hurt, or is benefiting in the public, or in private.",think didnt talk feasibility study done one challenges faced time lag want implement study done looked data data updated recommendation would timely feasibility studies like talking looking data 2019 one big challenges want implement ppp crucial much covered,61,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"it's not a matter of choosing, it's matter of delivering your perspective to some which way. the population will be benefiting with the public instead of private.",provide looking place mentioned discussion,62,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"who benefits, the most from a joint to public or private venture in the laboratory diagnostic.",,63,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"so, how the structure of the african, health diagnostic platform project itself affect dynamics at the country level.",heard ppp discussions never involved,64,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
thank you very much. so how interested are private partners in participating in the ppp? do you have some kind of historic background?,suppose ppp collaboration various partners lead task case believe task provide better health care people country,65,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"so, we are moving towards the end. ",know issues yes knowi business person many years know somehow issues especially facing lab sector,66,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"but the following the one is only for your plan, because we wanted to talk about the sustainability. what are or could be the plans in place to support the public sector financing in the diagnostics in the future?",us business laboratory medical equipment quite many years worked country definitely state certain problems see encountered health provisionnumber one procurement process believe problem procurement process overall regards see system laboratory gives needs testing tabulate centralized may rnl rbc procurement process believe sometimes sector nine teams missing procurement even start procurement plan consult us agree list items required process things left okay imagine order perform analysis need three components buy two components third component bought cannot perform one problemsanother one training users facilities case rwanda one apparently high turnover operators let us see today somebody works allocated work machine train gets experience months migrates somewhere else keep moving knowhow machine gone treasure creates problem okay keep moving really dont know see non stability operatorsanother thing encounter process procurement procurement institution used deal different hospitals past okay institution raises lpo contract raises lpo deliver products complete procurement cycle hospital pay lot difficulties getting money back give reagents come look money 1000 excuses obviously creates problem provide products paid previews provisionsanother thing know rwanda lot analysis covered insurance second products either covered insurance undercover give example test called example hba1c parameter analyze diabetics important know even diabetic behaves consumption sugar okay hba1c one expensive parameters apparently find lot hospitals running hba1c value covered insurance low okay cost test lets say 1 insurance covers half dollar go patient cover rest maybe doesnt half dollar pay rest effect analysis wrong dont learn analysis sacrifice diabetic health side effects also say side effects know uh uh patient uh monitor glucose good level consequences okay end side effects serious sugar example illness call illness silent dont pain dont anything dont effects come afterwards come maybe late kidney failure let tell government system dont pay 1 give example value dont pay 1 perform analysis could analysis patient lets say twice three times year 3 dont 3 expense come five years five years maybe save 20 patient needs transplant,67,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"yeah, so, which different sources of funding are expected to be used for financing the diagnostic?",okay give also example compliment comments comment asking yes past either sold placed machines market okay hospitals purchasing us time hospital hospital purchases two three years ago heard ppp done abbott machines lets say 50 hospitals suddenly blue machines abbott installed next machines hospital mmhmm lot hospitals stop buying us okay obviously run run problems abbott also came back us whatever government wanted partnership company proposed oh dont worry,68,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
at which proportion? because it's 80% external.,side said discussed 10 days ago problem work government organization providing goods services way used efficiently producing results patientswe said lot instruments market also assist sometimes bringing extra machines placement selling see models place machine yeah place machine sell reagents somehow higher price order make investment rwanda find people respect much placement model,69,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"so, a very specific one. if you have information, but you have a planner. so, how does the government include the financing support to the diagnostic and during the ppp period?",believe ministry health coordinator involved provision health services yes funders case money needed funding somebody provide money neededif funding could government something else believe stakeholders like medisell involved flow goods services project company regards organizing lets say control believe participants,70,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"okay, how the budget to finance lab diagnostics has been increasing in the government.",raise issues take consideration going partnership know like placement ppp kind small scale ppp enter agreement security behind say contract three years least respect contract three years ensure involvement see start project already doneall investments put lot money may 50 hundred thousand dollars hundred 50000 machines even expensive make investment day zero dont stop day three months reason said prefer use different machine understand,71,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
yes.,yes experience example laboratories one,72,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
how the government has been increasing the budget for diagnostic,okay company ask join project okay um said earlier company profit okay ppp expect work probably great way okay define party participate period expectation side respect suggestions partner,73,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
is there anything else you would like to discuss about the ppp that we have not yet talked about.,stability collaboration,74,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"thank you very much for your time. i don't know when you open the door for ppp or ahdp. you said that you will come in again as we discussed, and i will be happy to come back to you. if you accept.",sometimes depends models concept private company herewe expenses products maybe limitation money invest say example need two machines small machines small sites dont laboratory small machines nowin order project work need machines need people use give service ofthe machinestrain operators,75,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"so, the first question that we have in regards to this initiative is to understand if you are involved during the ahdp ppp process design process negotiation. ",know something every organization builds capacity according tolets say turnover according needs size grow know example asking give example although may asking example run laboratory run laboratory means need people machines material yeah im moving different leveli 25 employees cannot run laboratories lets say say dont want manage lab manage lab means every laboratory meet head count 4 5 6 7 8 10 people depending size lab obviously move different level yes long time capacity grow grow thats said earlier need stability know cannot double staff accept whatever needed input ppp next year next six months collapses understand capacity currently grow given assure going long partnership stable,1,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_13
"no. so, you didn't hear about this initiative before? ",lab diagnosis believe government look stability laboratories personnel laboratories good planning deliveries done laboratories run without deficiencies evaluate machines needed certain places yeah okayi dont know also money available purchase think okay believe since funders involved believe problem,2,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_13
"so, then i'm going to go to some questions that we have that are more general in regards to ppp so for you said that you have heard about ppp. yes. ",summary say open us private sector need ppp ppp word thing five years ago 10 years ago people may understand ppp different ways good clear expected ppp participant,3,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_13
"how would an ideal ppp design accommodate the needs of people, the priority population that we have in our country? ",thank hope helpful extent,4,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_13
"you know, the context of rwanda, actually i think, you know, somehow the context, the different issues that we have? ",thank im familiar african health diagnostics platform,5,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_13
what will be an ideal ppp design accommodate the needs of priority populations for you that will address these issues? ,attended back 2020 workshop organized chai ministry health exploring possibilities using ppp frameworks laboratory services rwanda discussing pros cons looking different services looking chain also service delivery part chain would suitable fall ppp one wouldnâ€™tand remember requested report workshop think chai one handling never received particular submission mostly ppp processes provided regulations clear decide take ppp route definitely must go processes provided course rdb usually come point negotiation,6,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_13
"what is for you? the ideal, like design, how you, as a private partner could work hand in hand with the government to improve the lab services in government facilities. ",negotiations though instances past different projects know investor comes maybe either us moh rbc expressed interest developing project usually work processso feasibility study sometimes might sitting part technical team heavily led supported line ministryand gather input financials especially people work financials advise see viability proposed project move approving steering committee contract negotiation,7,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_13
"so, i would like to, because these ppp you were not necessarily involved in all the steps and negotiation but i would like to ask you if specially to talk about your experience in ppp with rwanda and how this new initiative can learn from what you have done in the past here in rwanda. ",think order ppp successful think prior initial steps important actually areas feasibility study think important whoever leading either line ministry proposed investor adequate data develop good feasibility study thats going look mostly technical financial viability project percept ppp found important ppp process really feeds determines successful unsuccessful ppp end day results feasibility study definitely also inform would put contract parties would really also give good understanding project implementation look like parties enough data understanding findings know loopholes theyre trying achieve fix system theyll able pretty much implement sense direction information thats would propose,8,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_13
"so, and how for you, what are these stakeholders that should sit around that table to be able to provide that information needed?",think thats pertinent point definitely good management bad management break whole process break whole project vital things come contract negotiation youre putting adequate team team skilled knowledgeable partand ppp really comes help one objectives ppp public bodies relying private sector capacity expertise well even financing really know government institution public entity looking private sector partner bring extra level skill set might house even private sector could compliment negotiation important parties align management look like decision making processes place govern project,9,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_13
"so how would you during this example that you have provided of your the public private partnership with hospitals here in rwanda. so how would you i qualify the collaboration that you had with your public, counterpart. how was that collaboration?but was it still opened? were you able to talk to each other without any issues and clearly, and presenting the issues that you, you are seeing?",well dont know specifically answer lab diagnostic would probably give advantages disadvantages guess pursuing ppp really advantagesyou ability share risk partnersso thats public private usually risk allocated party equipped best equipped handle deal could financial risk technical risk whichever advantage share risk purposes project also ability rely private sector financing also relieves public sector know spending much certain key areas health educational housing whichever could allows public sector free bit budget depending contribution towards ppp also said ability ppp long term youre able even plan futuristically community society truly provide comfort knowing taking necessary steps beginning youve procured best person negotiated solid contract going govern asset resource quite long period time know need project benefit community years come,10,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_13
"interesting.so, and then based on what you have just explained, um, how can this experience that you have how can it be used to improve the next ppp arrangement? ",think supportive initiatives made ensure first legal framework date actually business needs society also provided different categories ppps used structured really provides clarity partners would say legal framework supportive relevant looks different scenarios highlighted key sectors economy instrumental helping people facilitating even better service delivery country,11,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_13
"so let see so i'm going to ask you questions about the interest of private partners in participating into ppp yes. so if that private partners are called to participate in a ppp, like the ones that we are just explaining to you, so what would be your main questions? ",think lot resistance beginning especially new law policy introduced definitely reservation choosing use structured mean going current steps provided law people thought lengthy thought would really take lot time might even maybe push away private sector thought people lose interest see extensive process,12,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_13
and then what will be your biggest incentives to participate in a ppp,im sorry maybe dont understand question flexible mean change another model,13,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_13
and what are the drawbacks? ,may bit tricky especially said taken right processes according law may bit difficult might terminate start afresh choose another option parties decided,14,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_13
"so do you think that if we were going to do something big like this, what do you think about the capacities of private partners in country in regards to that? they have capacity yes or no?",say different model mean financial model instance decided build transfer ppp instance want change maybe joint venture kind change youre talking,15,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_13
what would be the plans in place to support the public sector financing for the diagnostics? can you just discuss some of the additional maybe resources and be used public resources that can be used to support diagnostic?,okay important thing clear youre calling ppp youre calling privatization youre calling sale careful mix terms law clearly provides categories contracts niche agreements would fall ppp think four five double check theres build operate thatâ€™s may government allows build asset allows operate build transfer end specific term asset sent transferred back governmentwe management agreements well lease operate develop government lease asset operate develop point yeah bring something like privatization strict sense means youre relinquishing ownership rights asset youre giving away completely private sector forever youre going come back say know give back asset theyve paid private sector owner privatization thats completely different ppp,16,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_13
"so, is there anything else that you would like to discuss in regards to ppp that we have not talked about up to now? ",case co management know wouldnâ€™t go ppp process provided law think thats something either hospital moh rbc maybe put tender looking comanagers get pool interested people select get separate co management agreements would pretty much take ordinary contract arrangement opposed ppp thats detailed go feasibility study process clearance sort thing coming back question change would make sense lease operate develop example beginning thats parties agreed negotiated,17,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_13
thank you then. thank you for your time and your experience that was shared.,havent seen parties switch nature contracts especially ppps theyve really taken lot time negotiate beginning really tried factor risks know possible mishaps know many things gone process bit hard tell someone change havent seen practice time,18,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_13
"so the first question that we have for you is that we want to understand your involvement in the ppp process under the ahdp, the african health diagnostic platform in rwanda. so, and my question will be first to try to understand if you're familiar with the african health diagnostic platform.",havent seen many ppps health theres one hoping take effect still feasibility study stage looks promising taken quite long time developing feasibility study went process provided law expected feasibility study done approved contracting authority submitted steering committee progresses contract negotiationbut rest contracts seen health know theyre outside ppp format youll management service contracts know public sector private partner,1,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
so you have never attended any meeting where this was discussed?,mean private public,2,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
"i have understood well so you come out quite late in the process, during the negotiations.",think theres lot good faith parties theres lot collaboration think area partners willing explore willing get business think good think positive,3,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
"but then as you were not actually involved in all the design, especially the design discussions because we were looking at how coming up with a final design, and all the discussions that happened before we come up with a final design and we're interested to get more insight into those discussions.but nevertheless, we still have some few questions for you. the most focused on ppp in rwanda. ",either one ive seen youre talking ppp according law clarity,4,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
"so, from your standpoint, what are the key issues that the ppp that aims to improve lab diagnostic services should focus on or include to be successful?",well maybe also reading current law called implementation law number 142016 second may 2016 governing public private partnerships passed 2016 2017 believe let pull exact definition may clear get go,5,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
"and what about the management and finance and aslo the capacity, because when you started ppp you had also to ensure that you have the capacity in your institution. what do you think about that?",seen yet idea,6,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
"what are the costs and benefits of pursuing ppp, especially for lab diagnostic at this stand? ",havent dealt particularly speculate would assume thats something negotiate agree management workthats think,7,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
and the next question something that have a legal background so how supportive is the existing policy legal and regulatory framework for ppps.,yes would advise,8,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
so based on your experience how much resistance do you see among policymakers to ppp?,dont know answer,9,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
and how flexible is the ppp to changes for example in government priorities.,,10,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
"yes, yes",really varies forestry agriculture tourism ict energy mining mention,11,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10

if we have to do this again what do you think people should really insist and consider so that the risks during the discussions are minimized. can you speak a little bit about the risk or elaborate a bit about the risk?,changebut issue sustainability course model good sustainable long work together many people look way building sustainability example bring machine cost nine 50 million rwandan francs hundred million rwandanfrancswhich equal tothose subsidies want adopt many things people look say finance sustainable way cover thinking good,7,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30

"how do you think this project, when do you think that they use the rdb procedure or they first come to ministry and they haven't checked with rdb? what happens here for the ahdp?",rbc moh planning think involved rbc director lab chai planning former country director accepted well think others dont know levels involvement bmc boofmar lancet crucial rbc us also chai,15,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"what options were, or are still being considered when designing the model, this ahdp model?",incentives monetary good make friendly climate maybe workshop maybe people understand time bound meetings even online virtual dont know level involvement virtual meeting true focused read prepared know content able ask questions kind try neutral put another side future,16,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"so just quickly do you think for the co-management, we need different modalities, different design for example, contracting options will be, or regulatory consideration would be different.",dont know dont think one hesitance think shake administrative ministerial level aim something improvesome peopleare appreciatingthe services laboratory go appreciation level rdb among services appreciated ambulance services laboratory drugs accessibility know level change last year rms mean ppd reform needed different way addressthe access test laboratory maybe hospitals getting revenue cannot lie hospital manager buy cost x get five x five times four times example tell example hepatitis test profits pregnancy test profit profits may guess,17,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
how do you think how appropriate is the design of ahdp ppp to the local context? ,maybe hesitant yeah get something,18,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"so how would you recommend a process to have a very deep buying for key stakeholders? for example, what would you recommend to international funders? here? we are looking at someone like bmg, some station, like bmg for your investment bank.",im aware,19,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"you know, you just say piloting is one of them. what else do you think need to be considered? if we have another opportunity to do the ppp with lab services?",yeah maybe level ministers approached chai try explain project dont know,20,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"and you think that this was not well done, considering that, you know, understanding the old stakeholders mapping and understanding who bringing the table how do you see that should be done?",private partners spirit want things maybe see public sector risky difficult take investment payment process rssb take average 90 days right 180 wait days reimbursed could scenarios questions may see course every time say get capital inject ppp special treatment like loan reduced interest guarantee,21,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"how would an ideal ppp design, accommodate the needs of priority population? what is the best ppp in this one?",yeah look maybe people investing big hospital bringing many equipment equipment someone buy city scan heavy investment easy open also friendly environment business model country seeing many foreign investors cannot even right rwandan investors think comes something even attract foreigners invest,22,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
how would the ppp design address key considerations to improve access of laboratory diagnostics? ,lancet someone specialize laboratory others opening clinic also adopt laboratory bmc also unique laboratory model added clinical services maybe laboratory interested something private model,23,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
what factors do you think changed the discussion around the ppp? and how do you think separate question covid would or affect the decision on the ppp?,grants sustainableloans bank alwaysthe guarantee fear interest rate high suggest maybe loan bankbut law interest attract private investors,24,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"i was just going to ask for example, if ahdp is providing technical support and facilitating financing for these people, how would the availability of this support affect the ppp design? ",difficult kind ppp government infrastructure buildingsthe equipment much demands future investment government building hospitalsscale already services l specialtyit done many priorities prioritiesput hold someone sustain lab good us look areas invest,25,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
do you think that there's a way that you can do ppp without looking at the financial instruments or ppp must have financial instrument?,question isdid contribute lot beforei wanted tell tunga contribute dont enough information skipped meetings cause different reasons,26,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
how would you recommend ahdp technical support being used to address any of the gaps that you said weaknesses in capacity among his stakeholders?,role ppp process started think one year ago covid pandemic think 2020 may june chai came see minister minister called team went meeting country director chai introduced platform process minister minister tasked us work first established steering committee clear term reference stakeholders share okay developed together chai also colleague rbc lab division already work ongoing time issue completing data collection supported give introduction letter give data hmis opening data formal appointment minister steering committee appointment initial meeting workshop five days ps chair senate committee appointed chair committee first workshop team worked different people hospital private sector rdb university rwanda course enabel usaid partners quite good team composed stakeholders,27,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"how supportive is the existing policy legal or regulatory framework to ppps that we have? do you have a lot of resistance in the policy makers, or do we have different ways of overcoming those resistance? how flexible is the ppp to changes in the government priorities?",think around 20 ill give composition also share reports workshop musanze think july workshop discussed lot time brief get team thosekind confusion people people say know going bring one private sectorto monopolyit possible complementally abbott roche theyre see quite different think kind explain make people understand mean contribution initiative ongoing initiative initiative came remove initiatives quite somehow see get efficient way manage lab liked idea thats even continued push time big feasibility study shared mean input steering committee initial reports steering committee discussion approved document document shared august,28,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"and you talked about the abbott examples and you also talk about your experience as a, as a district hospital manager. so how were you involved in the past experience in the ppp? or even here as a in charge of quality head of department?",time like june started lab leadership involved current one previous remember even meeting preparing steering committee workshop former leader lab one proposed sample transportation liked sincerely speaking personally liked idea proposed let start sample transportation thats problems rather going full management ppps hospital took idea even committee discussed even though workshop quite mixture people whats first time introduced thats bring know monopoly versus discussion shifts know good one person manage lab,29,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"and how trusting collaborative was the relationship, or is the relationship between the public and private sector in this one?",yes immediately technically communicate officially chai think also meeting leadership chai country director chai introduction visit minister appointed meeting minister told process put hold one year probably end next year,30,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
what has been any historic investment and interest from government in laboratory diagnostics?or do you think it's align with the government priorities?,yeah two things mentioned two things mentioned dno also mentioned another thing say theyre going strengthen regional labs see blood ncbt regional office theyre going strengthen regional maybe need renovated put lab tests mean working nearby hospital machine hospital put ncbt office,31,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"do you think there will befor example, as you submitted the document to rdb, do you think you need to improve or work onhow the health work related to those diagnostic systemwould be able to actually accommodate all the new improvement? ",dont deploy see demand lack infrastructure also bottlenecks term service delivery one way even hospital declined dont backend positions donâ€™t know put going put say go freelancer look know yet contract feel frustrated somehow thats poor planning side,32,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"so, this is the list of people that would like to, we are actually planning to interview do you think we miss any, we would like to see any important stakeholder in that show card",yeah personal view minister ill frank dont think one year make difference change option ppp lab mean sample transportation know things number one think need sit together see mean probably one year agreed mean decided could time discuss advantages disadvantages cause im seeing helping much people even though understand time government fear engage private,33,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"thank you so much for those, do you think there will be an incentive to participate in the ppp you know, the ones that you suggest",think need lot advocacy bring leadership european investment bank see european investment bank already give us money lab ministry finance loan signed found rwanda engaging projects think also continue invest theyre going support us thats one things leave leadership district hospital first contact patient found proper sample transportation lab would busy big lab going well effective sample transportation really good time keep advocating see work also im seeing lot opportunity banks offer loans low interest rate,34,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
that's correct. thank you so much doctor whose interests are hurt or helped by laboratory diagnostic happening in public versus the private sector,moh mof private sector like cdc enabel usaid working supporting project engagement chai also involved,35,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"yeah. so, so probably at the level of the, especially at the health facility,",didnâ€™t involve psf involved private partners gave us someone,36,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"okay. i see. and, and that's where, or you think that there may be potential threatened to ppp or contracting arrangement because that's where the hospital gets.some support. ",laughingi align leadership dont champions leadership champions leadership minister health first one pushing even though put hold ministry health yeah ministry see think personal note time perceived pushed chai yeah conversation mean beginning evolving clear found kind government want remember discussion yeah,37,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"the fear, again, for me the ignorance is very difficult. and maybe you can have fear because you doesn't understand the project and you don't want to take risk. and sometimes in any projects it's boundary the risks. yeah. and some people fearing to take risk, due to a lot of fear.

"thank you so much. and we are almost there. so do, do you think there were any bmgf, chai and european investment bank? that influence level of ppp dynamics here in country?",think one mentioned earlier two options need sit together discuss revisit decision details stated,39,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
and the negotiation between chai and any of these bmg and european investment bankthe government were not involved?,im politician used follow speeches leadership lets saythe perspective ofour leader say every timeyou see private sector key actorso always say know huge cost taking right decision right moment huge cost lets say issues issues probably yet know still covid new variant still busy people need services compressive manner ive done good well scaling know services actually things time timely service also see citizen satisfaction rates health services still low low leadership supporting private leadership want us advance implementation doesnt go thats saying huge cost taking right decision right time people still need services system still problem donâ€™t protocols problem us taking decision could hinder implementation us dont level understanding mode technical level issue trying solve legal environment supportive except implementation,40,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
thank you so much. so you said that private partner didn't really were not involved when you started the negotiation with chai. what will you anticipate as a main question from private partner?,recommend think probably might sound aligned vision number one iâ€™ll recommend toinject money give funds partner think maybe funding arrangementstheyre maybe funding dont funding specific project somehow riskygive money privates operator somehow risky area yet known mean implemented country ill give similar example send well see bably came time clear digital health found government came sector service provision lets say example even though quite new digital health aligned government wanted course covid yeah covid come cause government want promote digital things investment government country vision,41,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"okay. thank you so much. and you think, first of all, they have capacity, if this was an open option?",thinkthat role government theyre negotiating especially regulation price good thing government issued pricing policy ministry order enforce policy press policy government regulate prices market person suffer either paying copayment,42,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"okay. do you have any idea of who could be the potential, a private partner in this say starting by the country?",dont specific issue gender considered comes prioritization cause like nowwe specific issue women cervical breast cancer think lets say example thoselab services lab tests prioritized especially thingsto make sure services women well provided,43,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"thank you so much. i know that we've been taking, almost one hour and 15 minutes.",financial side dont see depend time reference thats find private sector private operatoran example give sample transportationthe private sector brings money coursethe reason mean thats one think project think always get funds liquidity private sector inject start like startup capital already cater product side mean dont see financial salary risk far mean service provided problem could anticipate fromthe insurance also insurance way avoid depends way negotiate tariff yeah negotiate tariff government know insurance make low people access increase tariff become difficult people access call copayment general cant dont see financial issue role government regulate cost think could one anticipate financial issue,44,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"do you see any, any support in terms of coming from the government letâ€™s say, for example, we are seeing that the lab system are being improved. do you think the government has the room to inject more funds by itself?",think model quite particular thats suggest give example sdg funding developed partners coming engage moh two source funding philanthropy also fund central bank quite particular learn know lets give example specific area imentioned one covidbecause government provide leadership reporting know things monitoring make sure people reporting stock people getting results know theyre sensitive see think could quite similar,45,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"that's really very interesting. and i think you said it work it's to expand on the existing, not government to start in new. yeah. that's what you kept on saying that ppp could be one, one way as, as many others learn and stuff. and thank you so much, dr. thank you. i really appreciate. and before would like to ask if you have any question for us,",financial department moh involved discussion enabel rbc chai mof king faisal included cfo usaidunfp involve ceo psf included labs bmc lancet keep fdaand psa,46,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30

"and starting, just would like to know how your involvement in the ppp process under this project is?",ppp process started time wasnt yet position read report obtained done far side time came look report report national strategies putting place improve quality service delivered advice technical part technical team looked national strategies far lab concerned put place improve service look well recommendations ppp advice whether proceed ppp go national strategy strategy put place see whether proceed ppp time comes looked strategies put place time yes looked ppp offer yes advise ppp wait moment strategies put place implemented see outcome strategies therefore looking ppps proposing know type ppp prefer,1,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
"oh, wow. steering committee how many people in the steering committee? ",yes two strategies actually certain molecular testing also expanding tests,2,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
what was the process of negotiation over ppp how did the process vary by topic?,apart central level moment look four others meaning four one every province okay collision regional offices rbc provincial level province one office,3,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
and that was communicated to chai that will hold on for one year? ,going hard tell cause time discussing way happen seeing let start stepwise starting lets say different levels health system starting lets say referral level district level health center level even post health post level select every province sample representative whole country,4,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
thank you so much. and this process was put in hold because of there was a dno that was put in place to support?,really discussion open thinking actually first one one one way thing cant start simple transportation ppp see changed realize allowing samples move lowest level highest level easily increasing maybe volumes increasing volumes simply tell us need space lab equipment lab done cover volume increasing thats thinking move another step say lets move lab management ppp bring private partner equip need lab terms equipmentâ€™s technical staff cover gap increasingly increasing volumes samples,5,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
"oh, really?why? ",actually implies actually comes actually one top priorities rbc actually centralizing test central level least provincial levels create space central level special tests even research going depend needs given religion say example northern province already know diseases highly infectious ebola among diseases come uganda congo center thats going built itll vhf lab viral hemo fevers lab specific specialized among tests regions focus bacteriology lets say itll depend needs specific region seen issues specific region decentralize tests way tests moving different regions central level actually run labs instead brought central level actually implies main purpose rbc,6,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
"what do you think were the issues to implement the design, the ppp design to be designed and how, how these issues were discussed and resolved? ",decentralized services regarding quality monitoring mentorship training levelso fridge working nyagatare people dont start calling central level start calling central example rwamagana problem nyagatare easier respond also give space need central focus important things,7,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
what do you think would be done to solve those issues for the government to engage?,came ppp work actually done time report discuss remember many people couldnt really understand ppp remember given report quite big read even understand quite number people really understanding expect thing actually able understand time learn everything ask many questions least lab easy get yes say people many people hesitating making decision regarding ppp one think lack information actually information actually enough people grasp main idea pppsecondly lack information also lack people think maybe understood well people clarify position really understand go back strategies putting place,8,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
thank you so much dr. who do you think has been involved in the initial design of the ppp? ,implementing yes remember think january 2021 started dno time dont think knew even ppp yes first time ate came knowledge yes meeting called told know lab management ppp said dont know give quite huge report go read yes thats came knowledge yes like like april something okay already started implementing strategies,9,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
and how about civil society? did the civil society involved?,actually started position december last year think work accomplished okay time started report yes,10,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
i would like just to ask one quick question do you think we had champions for ppp for this ahdp? who are these champions,im sure dont information think yes think national reference lab level involved im sure im sure involved think far lab involved think maybe different levels im sure think lab involved time knows maybe even department realized people information level ministry ministry yes one report one following ppp,11,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
and how about do you have any actor trying to oppose it though the ppp on ahdp? ,think chai involved well ppp im sure partners im sure information,12,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
"what options were, or still being considered when designing the model? ",think ministry endorse ppp us maybe recommend us technical team whether going help us going help improved make efficient,13,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
do you think how appropriate is the design of ahdp ppp to local context? ,remember options lab comanagement ppp remember well simple transportation ppp dont really remember think three,14,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
what would you recommend as a processes to have a buy in all the key stakeholders?how about international funders? multilateral/ bilateral organization? ,think fit think optional think fit regulations far options proposed think fitting regulations norms challenge think norms far see makes impact norms actually okay ppp regulations,15,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
how would an ideal ppp specially this ahdp ppp design assure the needs of priority populations?,think new framework new framework actually explored actually one things brought actually hesitancy people used public institution partnering private believe yes private sector something offer bring public institutions worth explore,16,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
"how has gender influenced the design of the ppp? like male and female, do we have any problem there in terms of access of the services when it's come to ppp?",yeah think better approach implemented first know gaps public sector highlight ppp bringing fill gaps approach well elaborated ppp appropriate think ppp needs flexible needs actual needs system way make appropriate think bringing private partner depend spaces see system private come fit,17,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
"some of the things i discussed, any idea on the financial risk. what are the factors do you think, change the discussion around the ppp?",yesi take example reading lab comanagement pppso wasnt clear enough extent goes question government done far going put hands private partner going yes equipment infrastructures put hands private appropriate partnership looking like efforts far done government deliverthe services table considered many questions around think wasnt clear enough extent going implemented many questions around actuallywere clear enough therefore hesitancy course,18,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
"i see, thank you so much. i'm just going a little before. i know your time. um, some of the questions responded while you respond to others. ",think actually stakeholders need sit see current situation gapswhat contribution stakeholder fill gap better approach move needs management lab management even nature health everyone whos involved,19,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
looking at this list who are the key stakeholders in the ppp that were involved that we are missing?,lab like say lets say starting management lab going management biomedical services departmentthe management rbcitself clinical service department ministry health even people representing ministry levelshould involved also investment kind thing also berdb need also make decision whether investor coming investment happening yes partners say cdc chai usaidyes partners work daily basis improve quality service network need sit see done uh current situation better way move forward,20,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
"what could be the plans in place to support public sector financing of diagnostics? for example, if it's a lab, how much do you think will be needed to have, uh, a general seek treatment center? ",yes first recommendation remember say came knowledge meeting ministry think better approach start implementers actually us get management lab involved get lab involved actually proposed ones actually trying implement strategies maybe even policies coming ministry getting involved makes collected information even accurate even easily understood implemented later alone starting low level actually believe makes times comes implementation work even easier remember im seeing go report come present directors one knew ppp directors different units,21,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
"so the first question that i have for you is actually, i want you to describe your involvement in the ahdp initiative here in rwanda",look health system even service delivery think ideal increase access services decentralizing services lowest level possible best ppp actually act direction populationdown able access best services bigger package tests possible lowest level instead ofall time getting say tests able need go another level see patients lose lose way referring later get sick even able even put anymore preventable done even case wasnt decentralizing increasing access services priority key quality services,1,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"so if i have well understood you talked about national strategies and those strategies the first one, you said the decentralization of your lab offices. yes. as well as diagnostic network optimization",think need rework ppp even proposals different options ppp wasnt clear including really hard tell going benefit population wasnt really easy integrate existing system due limited think understanding report ppps wholethis comes involvement implementers supposed implement technical people supposed actually support ppp support hard really tell clear,2,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"yes. so in this decentralization, how many offices are you planning all over the country?",think okay dont model recommended think best model actually fitting priorities strategies talking talking lets say talking priorities centralize test uh even involved example place poc point care machines lets say ppp come yes yes private partner responding needs highlighted talking decentralizing tests centralizing labs ppp actually go direction key consideration,3,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"okay. thank you i've understood that you were not necessarily there during the negotiation, but based on the informationâ€™s that you maybe got from the person who was there before you.",yes okay thats said maybe need rework proposal combination ppp make sure actually updated actual gaps existing okay repeating duplicating done also see done covered yeah efforts put place start filling gaps ppp,4,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
what was the model that you wanted to implement? at that time the one that was selected,going hard answer cause discussion done limited level involvement therefore understanding ppp level implementers like something done came something understood high level lowest level wasnt involved enough one two looked ways going implemented starting part clear us whats meant impact even access quality among affordability pillars good service clear clear wasnt um wasnt clear enough implementers going done engaging partners invest health sector improve health service delivery couldnt really understand ppp equals government partners going tomarry make service delivery improvedi think clarity information actually good enough clear point raised,5,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
so i would like to come back to these national strategies to better understand them what does it imply when you are decentralizing? ,lab actually lets say three big department lets say human resources infrastructures finance make actually everything operates staff currently starting staff people structure structure marital structure brought projects want structure saying private partner comes going take staff everything answer example equipmentâ€™s existing theprivate partner comes partner going hire equipmentâ€™s buy reagent equipmentâ€™s run services maybe pay government government pay partner many questions think clear enough touching aspects lab going procurement even itselfwe know procurement done channels followed regulations bring private partner going change going impacted think levels comes information actually well elaborated many questions remaining unanswered,6,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"are you also going to decentralize everything that is related to monitoring and evaluation assessment of quality, or are those functions going to stay with the central level?",like two three meetings ministry questions im asking asked many people remained satisfied actually answers think comes actually im blaming high level believe technical people even level embracing understanding going happening also challenging comes people lowest level field understand needs understand gaps easy highlight point propose solutions issues theyre facing coming believe go comes could understand difficult even embrace implement,7,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"so going back to the ahdp negotiation process, were there any sticking points, where it was difficult to reach an agreement when you were discussing this ppp model.",itll depend talk financing actually one going financed extent finance come say im supporting half staff lets say half staff improve improve system yes support maybe solving problem yeah depends actually financing going even flexible needs even specifically flexible needs,8,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
so when did you start implementing these national strategies?,knowledge private laws im dont information getting laws govern ppp technical societies lab butits going able answer questionbut think people legal office answer best question office lab dont legal office yes legal legal officewho say okay laws laws govern private partners coming yes go much bigger,9,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
so meaning you were not there during the ppp negotiation and when they were at the design and coming up with different options?,yes abbott ppp report released third party maybe supported chai think report feasibility report proposing three different options three different options government losingthis beginning ppp implemented fast evaluated feasibility study realized three options offering saying given reagent free government losing continue buy give reagent free reduce staff lab half government still lose third give reagent free reduce staff half consolidate create new network talking thosestill government lose meaning options choose lose ask ppp,10,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"so who were the institutions, what institutions or people persons were involved in this design negotiation?",donâ€™t details details place equipment run tests government procurement would buying placement kind contract government would buying everything later theythey havethe feasibility study shows uh placement way working government procuring everything government works even build called center excellence quite huge project dont know negotiations started implementation ground rulebut yes revealed working okay really working good experience ppp,11,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
what about partners?,think theres issue trust actually issue would bringing table going improve thats actually main um main issue cause working partners bably operational giving services rwandans highly appreciated theres issue trust issue bringing fill see gap set gap approach different partners another one another private company actually tried present proposals solutions call lab home us interesting people reaching people example im office im diabetic lets say time lets say blood,12,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
what is the institution that is ultimately responsible for approving ppp project?,one priorities sector increase accessibility said services population national strategies lab well go directions theyre highlighted priorities health sector therefore said looking increase primary health care access people thats whenat level lab thinking decentralizing test thinking using point care machines thinking increasing packages tests health centers health posts thinking increasing accessibility digital systems lowest level able collect even information feed systems data help us even monitor even improve services actually provided different levels one example im taking show actually also align priorities health sector among many exist,13,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
so the first question is looking at the options that were considered during the design of the ppp what are these options?,level a2those lab long back secondary school two upgraded level a1 level a0 bachelors degree think structure think levels masters labs think bachelors degree maybe lab comes comes management people trainings general laboratory sciences,14,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
so this model do you think that they deviate from any regulatory norms or they can't fit into the norms that we have in the country?,starting ministry rbc key stakeholders theyre key implementers theyre one coming priorities policies health sector gor institutions including ministry finance planning important talked financial aspect ppp important bring ensure part also elaborated able get expect rdb important rdb charge investors coming country decision involve investor already easier time involved procurement agency cause procurement aspect also,15,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"so do you think that option of co-management, does it fit into the norms that we have, the regulations that we have framework that we have, and there is nothing that can go against that?",im im going try put feet shoes think everyone wants starting public going back private facilities work looking role partners cdc among actually actually embrace see highlighted gaps paid ptp actually approach stakeholders like bridge say okay gaps able fill gaps cdc able fill gaps remain gaps ppp maybe let says start financial aspect take loan taken loan fill gap able fill gap,16,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"so if you look at the design that were discussed and the one that was maybe recommended, how is it appropriate to the local context?",never afraid turnover time tell people train staff lab example test moves another lab im losing cause shes serving another one side yet trainings worse time continuous thing havent seen anything like threat turnover threat yeahyou know person moving one institution another hes serving hes serving gap hes feeling training planned continuous even theres someone new person trainedimmediately directly trainings would mentorship colleagues,17,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"you read the report, actually, maybe you were not being part of all these discussions, do you see anywhere a place where this was not going to work?the way the options were framed, maybe there is a place where maybe it was going to be difficult to implement that. ",turnover ppp processi think ppp said going process implement turnover cant stop way turnover yeah threat ppp think dont think threat dont think ppp approach system based something approach system based easily disrupted turnover unless system changes directions,18,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"do you think that when discussing about ppp, what are the stakeholders that should sit around the table to come up with a good ppp model?",system change mean shift priorities impact ppp direction clear people embraced approach ppp think turnover shouldnt threatbut think actually said feel also opportunity appear ppp opportunity fill gaps existing said someone moved another place someone new training transferring skills new person first lost hes still operating network hes filling gap one way,19,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"can you list these people that you're saying, okay, institutions, when you say everyone, especially in, in the lab sector?",thats good question im able answer im part private sector thinkeach every partner private sector private sector um yes feel reallyattracted publicby issues public compared private private actually manageable flexible comes public well regulated rigid uh marrying two actually requires private flexible enough fit public,20,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"what would be your recommendations, in a way of improving how the process was undertaken?",think actually everything actually reside around around privates regulated structured time know private want move fast find flexible ways time kids public perceive public delaying race,21,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
how would an ideal ppp design accommodate the needs of priority populations in rwanda?,think say existing gaps gaps know public private gaps yes attract private sector attract public sector manage actually work process fill gaps actually yes make also interests yes examples bably talked theres another one im talking lab home innovative idea think lab embrace really even encourage present present idea ministry yes looking gaps interested innovative ideas died,22,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"so now when you look at the final proposal we have for the ahdp and then compared to the ideal one that you are thinking of where are the differences, where are the gaps that we have with?",im sure think look services offer different labels volumes people outside terms volumes needs services frequentthey go private think privatepartners actually look example bmc special tests maybe arent able momentand proposed model model actually building kind capacity deliver everything need deliver bmc lab separate operating private lab may refer would yes yes contribute given levelmay level may wish contribute think yes certain level,23,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
how will the ppp design address key considerations to improve access of lab diagnostic?,im looking done loans government uh going inject private labs make sure provide service population government trying make sure covered public private challenge public times tariffs theyre covered theto protect issue remains level primary care population arewegiving access tests maybe build infrastructures equip state arts technology tariffs high covered rssb receive service im looking way keeps working government understands quality services population able mobilize funds make sure tariff goes increasing access service thats actually look even know private companies question okay accessible affordable actually comes issue,24,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"so if i understood, well, what you are saying is that i actually, this design was addressing a consideration that you had already started working on through the national strategies. ",plans ensure private sector services sustained financially actually think raise question discussing sustainability ppp question even im surprised also ask question thinking saying okay private partner coming partner public long sustaining making things run loan withdrawn government able sustain private partner sure good service seen delivered sustained aspect think maybe elaborated well report also ask way government invest,25,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
what are the factors that change the discussion around the ahdp ppp?,government also partners differentwhen talk private sector yet level say done public facilities strengthened financing private sector level yes working still improving question public sector looking mainly public sector public sector going finance mainly government yes private partners,26,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"what are the type of information that you wanted to be more sure? what are the missing informationâ€™s that you would like to have to, to understand better?",cant say level sustaining everything without partner first times still building health system need work partners cause different reasons improve also able benchmark havewith exposures partners yes able yet level say selfsustain still need partner work partners aim everything come strategies generating income see move forward level sustainability say answer theres still lot work make sure actually reach state,27,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
did you get the chance to ask those questions in maybe any meetings or forum to get more clarifications on this small specific?,started wasnt aware ppp new joining system didnt people joined really level lab level involvement wasnt satisfactory level one recommendations think people happen maybe today lets say future lets start lowest level well people going implement ppp talking start lowest level um said bottom make sure actually move whole package needs people understands way fill overcome highest level one important recommendation making comes ppp would like also share,28,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
if ahdp is providing technical support and facilitating financing for the ppp how will the availability of this support affect the ppp design?,im involved im involved lab provide supports ministry health ppp health sector offering guidance financial economic component financial support well case needed,29,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"when you look in the country what we have in place, legal framework and all the policies that we have regulatory frameworks are they supportive of ppp?",dont know project,30,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"and so let's discuss then if you can describe different earlier, for example, experiences that you have projects in country, in lab, any other experience in public private partnerships in rwanda?",thats basically technical question ministry health ppp country us transfer risks private partner attracting financing given project particular labs management rwanda technical aspects ministry health position elaborate,31,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
then you said that you had some ppp with abbott. can you explain how it worked? so what was exactly this ppp abbott?,educated feasibility study findings cannot discuss findings dont feasibility study conducted,32,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
how trusting is the relationship between public and private sectors for health based on the past experience?,themajor objective ppp feasibility study whether labs health sector general sector indicate kind ppp arrangement undertake whether build operate transferbotor build operate ownboo contract management areas feasibility study clearly indicate,33,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
we are looking at the historic investment and interest from government in lab?,ppp law also ppp feasibility study guidelines tries guide sectors including health sector proceed ppp,34,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
what is the profile of health workers that are working in the lab diagnostic system in rwanda?,ppp feasibility study three major components one technical component normally reviewed confirmed contracting authority say contracting authority case moh another component called financial economic viability project technically feasible must financially viable investor come invest project must economically viable especially government say financial viability financial returns investors government private party,35,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
who are the key stakeholders in the ppp and why do you think these people or institutions are involved?,let give quick scenario especially us minecofin thats saying give general overview minecofin oversee implementation ppp rwanda project financially whether health sector agriculture construction sector project financially viable economically viable project implemented private sector whether ppp private party alone financially feasible economically feasible product mainly implemented private investor economically feasible really implemented governmentso case ppp labs preliminary findings indicated project economic viable financially viable thats components technical team said go improve shall see whether project still financially feasible cannot give details made project financially viable scenarios wanted understand whether health sector sector specifically labs preliminary findings indicated project financially viable,36,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"so the next question, when you look at this list, we want to know how these different institutions, who, how do they perceive the, the advantages and disadvantages with the ppp?",case implemented government economically viable major reasons projected revenues revenues come reagents consumables number tests trainings expenditure making projects financially viable consumables reagents change either direction increase decrease understand findings going know preliminary reports technical team indicated feasibility study project financially viable understand would keep asking questions around technical viability technical aspects area mine finance economics cannot comment technical part help sectors understand importance assessing economic financial viability project,37,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"and then how threatening to the success of the ppp is the, a potential for turnover in key position among national actors?",depends stage ppp implementation study want clearly understand stage talking,38,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
how threatening is it the turnover to the ppp process itself? ,get well note different stages ppp project im sure hold accountable someone project yet started already started course go implementation ppp concession agreements signed normally ppps 25 years concession period government obligations private party obligations depending nature ofarrangement project bot boo contract management case trying see guidance check operational management labs depending nature arrangement able identify accountable success ppp party obligation government obligations fulfill private party obligations fulfill concession period,39,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"can you maybe explain that more like the system change, what you mean by the system change?",yeah like said contracting authority case ministry health according ppp law moh initiate ppp project private partner come proposal implementation lab management example hospitals feasibility study ongoing technical level provided feedback institution conducting supporting technically feasibility study,40,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
so then the next question is how interested are private partners in participating in ppp?,first contracting authority case ministry health interested health sector order words rbc hospital hospital contracting authority budget agency go line ministry rdb according law chief negotiator comes ppp implementation also mof finance economic planning areas infrastructure ministry infrastructure case need water electricity access land agencies public cases involve ppp assessment implementation,41,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"what are the otherfactors that may limit the private sector working with the government in the public apart from havinglike very rigid system, following regulations?",case need support transaction need capacities transaction normally engage institutions,42,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"what are the incentives for the private sector to work with the public system, to participate in a ppp in the country?",depends sector pool technical advisor position provide support needed whether terms negotiating whether need capacities private party especially areas think dont local capacities,43,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"when you look at the private partners that we have in country that are, what in laboratory diagnostic, do you think that they have the capacity to participate in a ppp with the government? ",many first nst1 national strategic transformation indicate economy private sectored economy rdb project assessment analysis feasibility study findings indicate project financially viable normally take project private sector come implement project government policies including national investment policy clearly indicate private sector engagement implementation major projects,44,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"so do you think that these private partners that we have in country, if they're provided with more fundings, if they can really provide the support needed for a ppp?",incentives investment code yes including tax exemption infrastructure access example want build hospital government provides access load internet connectivity water electricity able implement project,45,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"looking at scale up and sustainability, especially when looking at, when discussing around the ppp design. so the question is what are, or could be the plans in place to support public sector financing of diagnostics in the future?",far obstacles incentives good environment attracts private sector come partner government rwanda different capacities locally come project capacity dont need go outsource outside think far donâ€™t see issues private sector partner government,46,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"so currently, what are the different sources of financing for lab diagnostics?",im sure ppp project labs ppp project pilot phase trying check roll actually welcome many private partners come work government private partner ppp,47,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"then if you look at your, your financing plans that you have are they sustainable?",like said ppp feasibility study three major components others one technical feasibility project labs technical feasible rwanda labs produce different tests kind technology feasible rwanda hospital accommodate type labs rwanda technically feasible whether pilot phase need roll want conduct pilot call prefeasibility study technically feasible like said words feasible rwanda dont know whether maybe want rollouts across,48,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
so is there anything else that you would like to discuss about ppp that we have not talked about?,feasibility study study able assess technical viability project lab accommodated health post areas technical part component study assesses go components including financial economic viability components want conduct pilot go prefeasibility study works roll,49,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"thank you very much for your willingness to participate. i have took you really a very good time for your day. and, as i stated at the beginning, if the ppp move ahead to contracting, we will conduct a second round of interview. and if you agree, we may reach out again in the next few months to schedule another interview with you to see what to capture the new perspective, according to the development. thank you very much.

yeah. okay. so you are not familiar with african health diagnostic platform currently being discussed in rwanda?,donâ€™t think much add ppp area rwanda nearly new still opportunities people know come projects government health sector many areas ppp lots hospitals according nst1 targets reach get investors build hospitals rwanda area government consider even incentives specifically labs know government ministry health trying improve health service delivery labs providing good services patients expect good health service delivery study done lot hospitals even posts currently study trying cover hospitals,2,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
"yeah. and from your standpoint, what are the key issues that a ppp aiming to improve laboratory diagnostic services should focus on to be successful? ",thank much taking part study pleasure participate interview role actually medical doctor also managing director public hospital rwanda,3,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
"and maybe for you, the specific question would be what are the costs and benefits of pursuing a ppp in laboratory diagnostics ",came cross platform couple days ago reached participate study actually get informed otherwise previously aware platform thank,4,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
"so the study should highlight this, according to you?",thank much actually private partner contract public better service laboratory must proper treatment plan patients actually help two ways point view rather mentioned paper guide procurement process gathering reagents platform means machines sometimes procurement process may cause problems hospitals actually timeliness efficiency also without running stock outs private contracts help make sure business running effectively,5,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
"okay. and now, how supportive is the existing policy or legal framework in rwanda with regards to ppp?",understanding trying procurement process reagents delivered sometimes end issues reagents coming halflife end reagents expired getting arrived late issues transportation,6,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
"okay. if you can elaborate more about that improvement that is being done is it about laboratory networks, is it the sample transportation?",yeah exactly exams available hospital chance poor patients able get full examination examined get treated hospital level without getting transfers also costly patients socioeconomic side patients sick patients complicated cases get examined diagnosed treated hospital specialists appointed good thing country getting specialists appointed every hospital,7,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
yeah. actually what you say is very important for us because for a successful ppp it has to go through all those mentioned steps.,understanding think benefit hospital guarantee getting platforms functional availability reagents maintenance machines means side hospital sure vulnerable patients guarantee time lab system functional positive point understanding sometimes end getting reagents broken platforms may experience periods without getting functional platform think really beneficial private sector managing side lab really important,8,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
"so it means according to what you mentioned, it should be implemented by?",think answer bit limited point legal aspect get crossed understanding need regulatory system contact performance regular basis also accuracy results taken detected early stage failure aspect system try see addressed early stage think need structured way follow kind partnership otherwise challenge health system functioning,9,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
"thank you very much, actually. that is very clear. and maybe my next question is to know who should be held accountable for the success of ppp. ",think give example hospital abbott working together delivered platforms direct contact deliver reagents helpful functioning laboratory different actual way procurement process sometimes also take time people may able honor commitment abbott able maintain platforms able change platform deficient deliver time needed reagents makes life easier working actually smooth laboratory,10,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
"â€™s questionmaybe the whole process of the ppp project, from starting to the deliverables under the selected contract modalities or ppp",two main situations identify first people believe competition lead delivery better service second people fear change system another theyre sure effectively new system work,11,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
"historically, what has been the investments and interest from the government in laboratory diagnostics? ",think flexible identifying disadvantages advantages current system working benefits gain kind partnership think government look careful consent adoption kind partnership beneficial,12,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
okay. so who are key stakeholders that should be involved in developing the ppp and why?,thank much said looking one abbott historically success story relationship fruitful relationship effective hospital level helped much patients coming seeking medical attention able get good package clinical examination laboratory examination also imaging really improved good decision making clinicians therefore specific treatment disease helpful patients,13,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
"and at international level, is there other key stakeholders who should be involved as well? ",experience think thanks good leadership wellstructured way follow implementation parties fulfilling role contract talked abbott good experience giving good results,14,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
and what about funders are they also involved?,yes,15,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
yeah. thank you very much. what are the factors now which can facilitate or attract the private partners to be involved in the ppp?,abbott brought updated automatic platform able run multiple exams different samples time actually decreased turnaround time investigations running laboratory able generate results biochemistry immuneserology hematology areas short time least one hour therefore clinicians make good decision start curative treatment early stage keeping platforms good status maintenance early stage preventive maintenance creative maintenance,16,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
and what kind of biggest incentives for private partners to participate in the ppp?,think policy level need get kinds ideas set policy things run also end users see specific needs level end able request specific machines respond needs health facilities level think governance good decentralization government need see make framework working hospitals roles making specifications need authority follow needs respondedand policy level also way following implementation going okay needs identified timely responded wished,17,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
and what are the biggest drawbacks for private sector to participate in ppp?,think everyone role play gap policy level means policy level held accountable implementers partnership hospital level need actually see everything going well make sure communicate case problem solved soon possible hospital level ones dealing platforms think actually concession argument getting implementation everyone get know hisher part clearly heshe held accountable case failure play role accordingly,18,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
so do you think that the private partners working in a laboratory diagnostics in country have the capacity to participate and deliver on ppp? ,think investment performing hospitals teaching hospital level till health post huge investment done hospital also investment reasoning contract said abbott also others terms actually getting health workers different levels able investigations take decision early stage actually huge investment government rwanda lot hospitals labs functional helping clinicians level without getting patients transferred investigations done,19,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
how could the ppp be designed to achieve scale up and sustainability?,would align government priorities need actually get population treated get actually health system going decentralized level remote areas thats government invested lot constructing lot hospitals district level sector level going health post identifying infections community level also nutrition status patients get healthy population contribute effective development country,20,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
may be geographic scalability? ,yeah training organized actually different universities training student university level diploma levellab technician also bachelors degreelab scientists theyre able manipulate platforms able run actually needed investigations finish studies continue trained working different hospitals get refresher trainings adaptation new system,21,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
thank you so much. so now which are different sources of funding are expected to be used for financing diagnostics?,stakeholders actually ministry health part policy makers need also involve legal aspect say ministry justice legal aspect contractors line regulatory bodies everything also management hospitals involved assess benefits could gain ppp end users part decision introduction ppp order embrace changes,22,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
are the national health insurances also can be involved in?,think first person interested get diagnostic happening public clinicians need system learn quickly help patients regardless process matters time around time every investigation requested fast get actually everything investors actually get hurt one chosen part contract invest private area get profit case things available private hospitals attract people private sector government benefit population treated well even lower level services accessed healthy,23,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
"so i think many questions i have tackled on them, so unless you have anything else you would like to discuss about the ppp that we have not talked about.

so the first question that we have for you is we want you to describe your involvement in ahdp ppp process?,think one part sustainability financing since government budget dont think goes government budget dont think stop tomorrow members stop paying contributions insurance sustainable way services run threaten sustainability cost running lab since looked model reasonable enough public private operators lose providing service insurance didnt pay didnt reimburse enough guaranteed threat sustainability costing model respected affordability part sustainability would guaranteed,1,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
"so then are you at least a little bit familiar with it later on, maybe you were not involved in the, the process at the beginning since the beginning, but at some point you were somehow informed or attended some meetings about it.

and then do you know if your institutions was involved at some point?,yeah project coordinated head national reference laboratory,3,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
so this you are because you are not involved and your institutions also was not involved. do you know some of the specifics of this ppp the modality that were discussed during this ppp through the discussions that you had with your friends? ,yes,4,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
"so then, based on the few information that you have, do you know who was involved in this ahdp ppp in this discussion around the design of this new partnership?

then we are still going to go through what you heard about these ppp through different people. ,think considered health facility levels initial stage national reference lab three types equipment took two teaching university hospitals chuk chub recently appointed recently appointed referral hospital think ruhengeri kibungo well considered also hospitals borders byumba gisenyi gihundwe satellite lab yeah equipment needs infrastructure accommodate think hospital levels placed district hospital provincial referral hospitals national reference lab assessment conducted see volume samples tested selected hospitals basis negotiation,6,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23

"okay. so do you, are you aware of the different options that were discussed during this ppp especially when they were designing the model, the final model to be adopted? do you have any information about the potential model that were discussed?

"it's good. okay. so you know, that ahdp is a ppp about lab diagnostic, so really focusing on improving access quality of that while being also afford to the rwandan population. ",based cost,9,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
"it was mainly, looking at first of all, the public sectors, improving what the services are in the public sector. ",yes reduced cost comparing existing running costs different laboratory testsabbott reduces cost go beyond use today,10,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
"so, here we have the next set of questions, me looking at how the policy context and the different stakeholders can shape the ppp design. so the question is about, the legal system in place in country. and how is it supportive, to the ppp when you look at the existing policy legal and regulatory framework that we have in rwanda ",dont much detail negotiation think trying trying cost expensive,11,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
"so meaning you are suggesting that you are saying, first of all that people have a different mindset and we may face challenges and resistance yes. from players and in rwanda, we're not necessarily into ahdp, but in ppp arrangement in general, andto try to address these resistance, it's going to be good to share like examples or experiences across different sectors to show that ppp can work. it's not necessarily the devil. it can work and can get good outcomes out of it.

so you didn't move on with that ambulance project? ,much information,14,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
"how was the collaboration, the relationship between public and private especially, for example, if you look at the one that actually worked okay implemented with the health post, with ofh and sfh?",didnt yet know implemented ppp itll easy cause see social cases hospitals social cases like people think one dont pay government pay many social cases hospitals didnt yet currently take abbott ppp abbott currently running running like placement even roche placement equipment keep received leasing system equipment placed buy reagent extra cost equipment roche framework butif take lab management offer private companyi think two challenges one lab lab generated incomes managed private company every client pay im sure manage pay social cases buy reagents offer service business oriented serve dont focus vestment benefits business company comes think work benefits number one number two also labs hospitalsurvive incomes generated lab think two things think need challenge challenge,15,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
so then what has been the historic investment and interest from government in lab diagnostic?,okay accessibility think access package may increased hospitals offer clients yet equipment offer service problem reagents purchased accessibility think affordability think challenge,16,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
"so looking at ahdp, you know, a little bit about ahdp what is the goal of the ahdp? so according to you who are the key stakeholders that should sit around the table when they're discussing ahdp ppp?",think mentioned think talked cost turnaround time think reducedbut cost dont think change business yes business way designed invest recovery invest okay,17,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
"so then how does these different these different stakeholders that you have listed, how do they perceive their advantages and disadvantages of the ppp?",covid19 affected ppp design abbott platforms meet volume sample needed testedthe volume samples huge machine could run compared volume,18,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23

could we say that those are going to be the most the people are benefiting the most from this public private partnership. ,much information im sure,22,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
"so how interested are private partners you think in participating in ppp like this large, ahdp ppp especially in our context? ",really much view people involved,23,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23

"so, and then do you think that the private partners that we have here in working in lab do you think that they have the capacity to participate and deliver on a ppp? especially when we are looking at the ppp the ppp that ahdp was looking at was really something that is big, where, uh, could move from just doing sample transportation to something that is like co-management of lab network.

"so do you think that private partners that we have in the country will be interested in taking up the, this available financial instrument offered by ahdp? ",may say sometimes support keeps decreasing,27,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
"so these financial instruments may somehow, i don't know, good incentives to them, maybe to participate?",thinkwell think even maybe didnt discuss see abbott designed initial stageand implementedi thinkit didnt reach objectives initial plan take management public laboratories currently project run like placement system like partners wanted run labs manage incomes generated shares incomes generated government sell project run like system may say ppp project designed didnt reach objectives,28,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23

",involved implementation much involved implementation think challenge reach objectives first one social cases dont pay medical laboratory services two incomes support hospitals support hospitals funds generated helps functionality hospitals,29,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
"so please, can you describe your involvement in the ppp process and the african health diagnostic platform in rwanda? ",worked senior associate chai rwanda team provided lab technical inputs ahdp work alongside colleagues one knowledge costing side work one overall oversight strategic direction alongside global teambut role lab technical work team,1,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
thank you very much. who is that person who has the information so we can target him/ her for this interview? ,yes,2,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
"there is no problem. you can provide the information that you can have but you are familiar with this african health diagnostic platform, as it has been coordinated at national reference laboratory. at least you have some information on it?",yes yes okay,3,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
so what was the process of negotiation of this ppp?,happened prior assessment lab network lab network realized listed number challenges documenting challenges different lab system areas policy quality assurance took time understanding entire ppp model guidelines rwanda clear understanding ppp steps able propose number models privatization thought would address challenges country also reduce cost terms running laboratories also improve efficiencies laboratory services,4,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
"how did this process vary by topic, for example, the facility selection, procurement model and the contract type, including referral network and other things? ",one discussion major stakeholder ministry health rbc ministry health rwanda national laboratory discussed realized basically kind stating problem solution also discussions number stakeholderâ€™s agreement assurance companies private sector,5,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
so what were the sticking point around the ppp design and how will they resolved? ,mainly rssb one first one also looked military medical insurance bit looked deals activated costs going healthcare laboratory services price ranges thats looked yes discussions private labs also kind private labs dont remember one exactly remember like lancet offer services much compared much offered decide well conducted number contacts hospitals regional andreferral hospital stakeholder minecofin understanding also rdb team discussions course global teams discuss number modalities stakeholders really head,6,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
"who has been involved in the initial design of the ppp on the side of the government, on the side of the, the partners, ",lot input national reference laboratory ministry health key people also lot back forth stakeholders really present site minecofin rssb major people present front us mainly rdb ministry health national reference laboratories also minenfra,7,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
"how did the initial design change and during the deliberations,",one study feasibility assessment laboratory network identify challenges feasibility study kind rigorous analysis technical financial sites risk analysis kind evaluating cost impact implications partnershipbut got later lot doubt findings assessment 2019 data said get updated data captures data maybe 2020 2021,8,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
"yes. so they did they, did they change the cost? ",yeah think rough estimate investment around 20 million build structure expand surface service offerings thought would come cbhi government insurance patients private part needs kind cape index around 15 million 10 dont remember well dont access files already,9,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
"how did this change affect the process, would affect the process of the design and the negotiation?",policy property remains think also sign nondisclosure agreement rwanda biomedical center authority take copies file okay protected supervisor,10,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
so who or which institution would have been ultimately responsible for approving the ppp design? ,yes could introduce better service offering terms number tests offered could also improve efficiencies system practice better services population actually refused,11,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
"what option were all are still being consider when designing the model. so the different contracting options, for example, the consideration geographical spread. so refer network like that",think got stuck fighter recommendations getting recommendations models study took lot time final recommendation approved rdb would able launch tender also contracts offer contract implement ppp never went pass remained recommendations models kept revising think looked status poor public responsibility look call session privatize entire system apart infrastructure laboratory space government property another model called comanagement whereby aspects laboratory like staff data infrastructure handled government rest like instruments procurements capacity building things quite control managed private person also challenges said okay private partner control staff compensation things around patient data tracking recording even understand modalities enumeration private partner theyll getting kind commission offering service government agencies would hard yeah thats initial models ended things like sample transport,12,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
"how appropriate is the design of african health diagnostic platform public private partnership to the local context? for example political, social, economic and technological environmental housing, the agnostic market.",yeah add cut designs acceptable feedback gentleman joined later replaced former division manager rnl,13,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
"how would an ideal public private partnership design accommodate the need of apriority population, for example, the poor household, the complicated patients? ",acceptable address immediate concerns like sample transport someone used say brought private partner manage sample transport system without invest much energy staff managing sample transport sign contract give things privatization cannot sign contract also agreement yes sample transport something really acceptable someone manages laboratory accreditation think massive gap one love quote accreditation rest models,14,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
so how would the ppp design address key considerations to improve access of laboratory diagnostics in ppp is proposed?,next looked put kind statu quo looking things like staff hiring managed public said fully privatized concession operate directly within hospitals private law disagree said cannot handle laboratories private plan would need serious approval higher levels think co management kind caused issues public labs continue operate private sector partner basically recommended highest volume labs private partner would maybe gain level income volumes co management came would understand okay staff patient data managing data would charge collecting funds different sources much would end paying private lab partner supporting things took long negotiate much would pay kind payment mechanism place took longseemed also limited things like infrastructure staff patient data left rest things like capacity building mentorship procurement supply chain things also like maintenance equipment left entirely private partner okay talked either concerned able determine staff hiring conversation people meeting targets kind affects performancethey need full control staffing thing also private partner looked lower staffing would able motivate better hit targets much better even profit government said cannot release staff let go staff go,15,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
so what factors do you think changed the discussion around the ppp? ,steering committee steering committee honorable minister think dg people rnl ministry health would wake tomorrow cabinet changed someone honorable minister dg relieved duties lab director longer introducing concept new person every single time took us back lotso major problem would champion today tomorrow dont champion longer moh longer rnl longer someone part work,16,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
so how has covid-19 affected the ppp design? ,former division manager rnl also current dg planning moh also former country director chai current minister health introduced anything went rdb committee said needed sign honorable minister switch caused problem dg changed another issue altogether knew rbc changed rnl changed took refer new clinical division manager think later saying okay lets try something around sample transport entire model,17,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
"so if ahdp is providing a technical support and the facilitating financing for these ppp, how will the availability of this support affect the ppp design? ",yes honorable minister would one sign steering committee recommendations goes rdb rdb signed rdb would launch tender start negotiations think never crossed constantly remained moh think later realized another problem dealing lot moh people everything also hoping nrl backing us later realized said need lead lab program nrl owned said part discussion along want back proceed kind conflict bit terms institutions,18,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
so what are the features of ppp design that would not be possible without ahdp technical support?,copy complete different direction whenever would change leadership things also think mainly change leadership would different challenge like throwing different ideas entirely yeah,19,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
so the how supportive is the existing policy legal and the regulatory framework for the ppps? ,comfortable sample transport comanagement think little bit understandable wasnt really bringing also changes lab network asking someone take entire actually addressing main challenge terms sample transport sites probably acceptable discussions advanced yeah,20,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
how much resistance among policymakers will this people need to overcome to garner the necessary support?,think said discussion late last year realized might enough yeah done laboratory diagnostic network optimization looking lab system recommending kinds changes alongside prefeasibility study facing challenges also dno side instructed changes improve lab network things recommendations accepted dno think new leadership nrl said needed implement changes lab network period time example one year two years assess improvements areas taking ppp models okay realize coming end grant people gotten back fast turn assess network see things improved get back kinds model discussions bmgf,21,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
"what other recent or area experiences or project have there been in a country that can provide lessons for ahdp? i think this is, what you have been discussing. and you were involved in the abbott.",okay one things set address four things access improve access improving timeliness improving quality cost reducing cost diagnostic network things wanted set transform okay lot coverage good results good quality less cost prefeasibility assessment showed us clearly example turnaround time two months sample collection results delivery national policy service offering think around 100 plus tests 27 offered public labs imagine 100 plus test offer 20 something thirty health centers 50 less test kind made service package,22,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
how the experience of abbott was similar or different from african health diagnostic platform?,health insurance red one rate much lower market offering reagents would need discussions get agreed upon submitted things still going challenge national insurance cases really addressed discussions terms pricing think theres lady moh dont remember name well took discussion passionately never resolved think left unresolved day dont know tell going,23,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
so who are the key stakeholders in the ppp? and why are they involved? ,exactly know tariffs made way back things changed improvement come costs gone,24,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
"what are, or could be the plans in a place to support the public sector financing of diagnostic in the future? so which different source of funding are expected to be used for financing diagnostic? ",opinion always thought excellence would help us problem,25,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
do you have information about how government increased financing support to diagnostic during the ppp period of for example the,know people listen president lot,26,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
so what is the consequence of not reaching this initial plan for the system?,think made allow laboratory take efforts improving laboratory system according dno recommendations assess impact work year quick feasibility see remaining gaps design model addresses challenges addressed efforts mean travelled widely say government staff government rwanda people really work hard passionate work theyre passionate way work work hard im comparing uganda staff come 2pm disappearedso im compare yes rwanda passionate work take efforts assess need based would accept okay two years point need help area big quick reassessment lab network kind tweak recommendations based knit time maybe acceptable without trying best would feel people jumped without helping yeah,27,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
"so the first question that we have for you we want to understand your involvement in the ppp process, under the african health diagnostic platform in rwanda. so if you can please describe your involvement.",think need understand faster would need fully understand landscape laboratory would still proper feasibility study lab kind study also last thing would widen net terms stakeholders limited nuclear change introduce others everyone table steering committee people constantly engaged show benefit ppp activity also bit think would earlier discussions private sector insurance companies couldnt government owned community based could also privately understand manage cannot managed also think one things would need help country would start immediately get go negotiating real debt course including things like bundling price per testand reagents manufacturer always country agents manufacturers aligned country need terms cost volumes available country think would,1,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
"okay. so, we can say that you're pretty familiar with the project. right.",dont know valid one think scenario whereby people fully engaged discussing covid19 hit around march discussion died entire ministry jumped covid19 thats time added live conversation pandemic another thing altogether know went lockdown say one things conversation died one momentum one factor also affected things like cost higher higher cup subsidy going higher people willing pay money pocket money cbhi going put money one things yeah,2,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
so you participated in each of the state of this process.,entire ppp deals live someone able get loan facility never felt like lab way get whole sell loan build infrastructure according standard loan got setting nrl new facility european investment bank entirely outside ahdp could affected dont know really got wanted terms getting loan run system paid slowly never felt people wanted hear anything like getting loan wanted see something around private partner bringing money run thing get dont want anymore loan thing sticking point,3,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
"and. okay, the first part of this interview is going to look at the specifics related to the design negotiation.",yeah thats one things loans approved really high may highest level kind came sticky point,4,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
"so we would like to know how, what was the process of negotiation of these ppp? for example, the process during selection of facilities where this initiative was planned to be implemented, the model that was chosen, how did all this process go. if you can describe that for us?",find regulatory environment quite bureaucratic devoid people make decisions made people relay information higher someone else make decision people steered clear hard decision,5,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
"so i would like to better understand, especially when it comes to the models. so because the different models that you proposed, i think you had some discussions.",yeah people little bit fearful making decisions thing think find rwanda rules basically avoid form corruption good watertight steps good thingand good see country follows guidelines letter kind bypass procurement steps example uganda someone come talk honorable minister contract signed tomorrow rwanda happen upside fast admired admired people following letter example abbott deal think signed 2016 feasibility dont know signed full thing day,6,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
excuse me when you say insurance companies. can you say which ones?,thats one things steps rigorous think theyre supposed corruption proof thing really bureaucratic got think bmgf needed give time timelines giving controlled environment without bureaucracy something quickly get someone pick contract okay lets go tender fast know speed giving taken every government equally know government processes think need respect government processes timingsso flexible hear things like lets first effort another feasibilityso think bmgf needed hear strict timelines controlled environment would work dont know either kenya managed really ghana ethiopia fully,7,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
"putting together these different models. so they had like you discuss the model, or it was just stakeholders that were involved in providing information.for example, on cost, on average because we want really to understand, during the discussion onwhen you were shaping, designing the different options to understand who were the people in the room. during this step.",yeah like bmgf eib pushing us get thing need get loan kind got us sticky point pushing hard government entities push hard looks little bit tricky,8,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
"okay, so then during the next question is really looking at, i think you had those discussions, a lot of back and forth between the different teams and people are bringing some concerns you trying to address their concerns.",hard time deadlines bmgf sleepless nights sleepless nights government,9,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
"itâ€™s really interesting, we were struggling to get people who were really involved.since the beginning to have a better understanding of the process. and i think you have a lot of information as a technician who were involved like, highly involved in all these technical steps. ",think rwanda exemplified theyre open ppp several think orthopedics something think eye care something sticky point get loan think stood really hard open someone working us partnering us signed contract going take loan immediately without understanding getting loan,10,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
"omg, you didnâ€™t save them into your computer, for example? ",injecting money negotiating yes theyre open section healthcare priority needs addressed private partner compared countries rwanda open private partners think one stood really clearing loan issue pace pushing government get side deal get loan,11,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
"oh, i just wanted to understand better the cbhi right so based onyour calculation estimation so you found that the rate, the theory for the cbhi may increases and that's why you had all these people disagreeing with that.",really heard knew portable private players lab sector like lancet terms issues laboratory private sector really heard remember something also rwanda open discussion global public health foundationgphfheaded professor company offers services laboratory accreditation thought person came sourced funding cdc terms grant support government basically picked uganda cdc uganda get gphf support public laboratories towards accreditation knowand kind private player coming applying cdc grant something discussions open still come back even got people getting loan eib theyve used gettingthe funding examples petfarbut petfar rwanda opened kind work different,12,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
"yeah, i understand. i think i participated in one of the virtual meetings where they could see also that there was an increasing in the health insurances, especially the cbhi will pay. and i remember that some people were like no, how we can think its increasing. so someone from your team tried to explain that actually this is because we're providing more services also we have more efficiency.",biggest incentive join theres money made think concerns really volume terms test people exemplified volume volume means gains also payment modality government know something also stood would get compensated offer services think drawbacks really,13,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
"so actually what we can say here is that the initial design as you said you were proposing co-management or privatization, but then because of all these challenges that you faced the one that you discussed then you had to propose other design, after like the sample transportation.",think country private partners basically still outside mainly south africa like lancet could see capacity realcountry ones really capacity mainly outside would inside many outsiders working inside local ones big capacity yet,14,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
"so they proposed the sample transportation, it was more acceptable. ",cannot get head right think ppp model need continue conversation would benefit people firsthand would benefit peopleno matter much government put pushes skills pick outside example accreditation laboratories things around sample transport see blood transfusion drastically visualized rwanda big thing people see drones managed someone think conversation handled discussed people see think worthwhile starting new discussion,15,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
and what i was going to ask. and model that you proposed before the other designs. so what did they say about it. the other around co-management or privatization so they said okay let's start with this one it's more acceptable it's addressing one of the most urgent problem that we have sample transport.,think one need bmgf wherever still interested private ahdp give time one improve capacity understanding government services also priorities lies within private sector would good need educate private sector address challenges opportunities government address challenges capacity building one thing knowledge sharing open transparent technology sharing also bmgf facilitate process see actually increased understanding role private sector within public institution something needs lot time try grounded everything think yet forgotten people able one good thing think needed done,16,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
"so something else that we wanted to understand better along this process, you have this different actors that were involved in this process of designing the ppp, did the main actors changed along the process and how these changes affected the continuity of the process to the final discussion",thing think fell mind recommendation would ngos working either bmgf nothing support form support dedicated support people sit ministry day day sitting ministry people embedded system would kind bring trust process also interact every day think thats important people embedded team working within daily many tests could decide remember government official works ministry like champion something think gives liberal,17,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
"and like you said, but also maybe that's what we felt also from some of these interviews we've been able to do. like some people who came after we're not briefed on the larger project,ahdp. when you change the administration sometimes some of the activities that were implemented are stopped.",yeah two things really matter lot motivating people financially get work done mean could hire make seconded ministry embedded system get buy,18,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
"okay. so, and then you know who have been responsible for approving the ppp designs in the process. you said the minister, right, is the one was going to be responsible for approving the ppp before anything.",yeah also felt like imagine ugandan colleagues america mean tell rwandan component wanted someone national never seated ministry health even nrl would visit meetings never seated rdb seated office time,19,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
"interesting. and during this process of designing these models. so, you didnâ€™t have maybe some other people that were taking you to a complete different direction.",worked look dealing lhasa many tasked best hired people seconded moh seconded rdb asked understand internal challenges know read minds leaders see champions even change minister dg actually show institutional picture kind enumerated embedded system locals nationals areidentified everything,20,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
"so, until you left. because maybe you didn't know, after that so what were the option that people were considering. it was after with all the different models that you presented. so, towards the end, what was the model that was considered the most?",want come back rwanda see dno passionate dno recommendations would like come back see progressed meet former head department biomedical services,21,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
"but it wasn't addressing all the problem, it was addressing, i think one of the main problem but what about the other problems. what was their plan to address them?",hasnâ€™t even implemented design gone say never seen country many changes short time dealt stakeholders understandable also method thats probably least corrupt region nonsense kind thing think dont know,22,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
