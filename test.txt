KEY INFORMANT INTERVIEW WITH FULLY INFORMED PARTICIPANT
Date: 6/DEC/2021
Place: Rwanda National Laboratory
Time: 3:00-4:50 PM
Subject type: Head of Clinical Division 
Interviewer: Dr Sabine Musange
Note Taker: Tunga Grace
Country: Rwanda

Interviewer:  So, thank you for agreeing to meet with us today and thank you also for consenting that we record providing your consent for the interview, but also that we can record this interview.  So, we are part of a team that is evaluating the African health diagnostic platform, as implemented in Rwanda. So, we are working with Johns Hopkins University in doing this evaluation and the AHDP platform was created in order to improve access and quality of, lab diagnostics in different African countries. And I currently, what we are trying to see is really to describe the PPP design, because the idea was to do that through a public-private partnership within these countries. And currently, we're conducting interviews to get more information on how the PPP design was implemented here in Rwanda. 
Let’s start

Question 1.
Interviewer: So, the first question that I have for you is actually, I want you to describe your involvement in the AHDP initiative here in Rwanda

Respondent: From the PPP process when started at that time, I wasn't yet in my position, but I read the report but was obtained from what has been done so far. On my side, at that time, when I came in, I had to look into the report, what is the report? And what are the national strategies that are put into place to improve? The quality of service delivered advice as a technical part of the technical team. So, we looked into the national strategies as far as the lab is concerned that are put into place to improve the service. And look as well into the recommendations from the PPP and advice whether we proceed with the PPP or if we go for the national strategy or strategy is put into place and see whether we can proceed with the PPP when the time comes. So, we looked into the strategies that are put into place at that time and yes, we looked into what the PPP was to offer. And yes, we advise that for the PPP we should wait for a moment for the strategies put into place to be implemented and see what the outcome of the strategies are? And therefore, looking at the PPPs proposing and from there, you know, which type of PPP you can prefer.So there are strategies that we're put into place, including the centralization of services offered the national reference laboratory into regional offices of RBC. So this strategy has already started to be put into place. Yes, it may take one to two years to make the site functional and start evaluating what can be the impact. We have also started working on the recommendation of what has actually been recommendations from the DNO domestic network optimization. That was also part of work done by CHAI this is for molecular phones, where they were looking at the system, a referral system that we have and a lab network that was existing and see how they can optimize the network to make it more efficient. So we have certain put all those strategies into place and as we move on we look into a way we can also evaluate the impact and therefore one, two years from now see whether we can hope for a PPP and which can be a type of PPP to go for. So this a level where I was involved as far as the PPP and AHDP is concerned.

Interviewer: So if I have well understood you talked about national strategies and those strategies the first one, you said the decentralization of your lab offices. Yes. As well as diagnostic network optimization

Respondent: Yes those are the two strategies, actually certain from the molecular testing, but also expanding to other tests.

Interviewer: Yes. So in this decentralization, how many offices are you planning all over the country?

Respondent: Apart from the central level where we are for the moment we look at having four others meaning four, one in each and every province. Okay. So there will be a collision of regional offices of RBC, but there will be at the provincial level in each province we will be having one office.

Question 3.
Interviewer:  Okay. Thank you I've understood that you were not necessarily there during the negotiation, but based on the information’s that you maybe got from the person who was there before you.
 And we wanted to understand better how was the process of negotiation of that AHDP PPP at that time how did it happen?  

Respondent:  It is going to be hard to tell cause I was not in there at that time but when we were discussing in a way this can happen we were seeing, do let start stepwise starting with let's say, different levels of health system starting from let's say a referral level district level health center level, even post health, post level and select in each and every province, a sample that will be representative of the whole country. So we were proposing to start that way by a sample and see how this model impacts to the service delivery. And before we scale it to the whole country, yeah, this was actually something new that we thought it's innovative, but as we know public institutions especially when it comes to lab, everything is bought by the government and all the partners, of course, and bringing in a private, partner into the PPP wasn't actually easy to adopt, putting into consideration or those existing structures. So we said if we are to implement the PPP and that is going to be the approach to take to go stepwise by selecting the sample, which is representative of the country and give it a time, let's say one year to see what is going to be the impact in terms quality of service delivered, and also the efficiency how actually financially it's game-changing.
  
Interviewer: What was the model that you wanted to implement? at that time the one that was selected
Respondent: It was really a discussion which was open but we were thinking about, actually that was the first one was that one, that one was, was that way. But the other thing was why can't we start with a simple transportation PPP and see how it's changed. And if we realize that by allowing samples to move from the lowest level to the highest level easily is increasing maybe the volumes. And if it's increasing the volumes, that simply will tell us that now we will, we need more of space for the lab. More of the equipment for the lab, more has to be done, and so on to cover the volume, which is increasing. So that's, when we were thinking that now we will move to the, to another step where we, we say that now let's move to the lab management, PPP, where we bring in a, but a private partner to, to equip if need be the lab in terms of equipment’s, themselves, or technical staff to cover the gap, which is increasingly to the increasing volumes of samples and so on. o they were two different approaches that we were evaluating. But I think the choice or decision that will come when the time comes after the national strategies put into place, actually have been evaluated and big gaps have been highlighted.

Interviewer: so I would like to come back to these national strategies to better understand them what does it imply when you are decentralizing? 

Respondent: Actually it implies that actually this comes actually as one of the most, top priorities of RBC, which is actually the centralizing the test from central level to, to at least provincial levels. So they can create of space at central level for special tests and even research. So this is going to depend again, on the needs of a given religion, you can say, for example, in the Northern Province where we already know that diseases, which are highly infectious, such as Ebola among of the diseases come from Uganda and Congo. So the center that's going to be built there, it'll be having a VHF lab viral hemo, fevers lab, specific and specialized for that among other tests, while in other regions, they can focus more on, bacteriology let's say, so it'll depend again on the needs of a specific region and what we have seen as issues and that specific region. So we will decentralize all those tests in that way, so that the tests we moving from of those different regions to the central level actually be run to those into those labs instead of being brought into the central level. So this actually what it implies, and this is the main purpose for RBC.

Interviewer: Are you also going to decentralize everything that is related to monitoring and evaluation assessment of quality, or are those functions going to stay with the central level?   

Respondent:  No, we have decentralized all of those services regarding the quality monitoring and all those, the mentorship, the training at that level.  So that if a fridge is not working in Nyagatare, then people don't start calling the central level, but they will start calling a central to be, for example, at Rwamagana that they have a problem in Nyagatare. So that will be easier to respond to. And also give that space that we need at central to focus on more important things.
  
Question 4.
Interviewer:  So going back to the AHDP negotiation process, were there any sticking points, where it was difficult to reach an agreement when you were discussing this PPP model.

Respondent:  When I came in the PPP, work actually was done at that time. There was a report out that we had to discuss. I remember that many people couldn't really understand what the PPP all about. I remember that I was given a report, which was, which was quite big, and I had to read even myself to understand. So there are quite number of people who were not really understanding what it all about, and they were expect thing actually, myself, to be able to understand. And, the other time I had to learn everything, I had to ask so many questions, at least I was from the lab. It was easy for me to get, yes, I can say that people, many people were hesitating, and to making decision regarding the PPP one, I think it was, a lack of information, which was actually information, which were not actually for me enough for people to grasp. What is the, the main idea for the PPP?  secondly, there was that lack of information, but there is also a lack of people, I think, who are there before maybe to and who understood well, what the people was about to clarify, what is all about, and being there in that position where I have to really understand what it's all about, and again, go back. And what are the strategies that we are putting into place?  Yes, I had also to again, think twice we are now I, these strategies and the PPP is here what comes first? What comes after we have started the road, implementing the strategies? Do we stop in the middle of the way? And we start implementing the PPP, or we move forward to the accomplishment of the national strategies and evaluate the gaps that that will be there to, so it was a decision that was not easy for me and even for others. Because we had a report meaning that there was a work done before with the recommendations, but yet we had other recommendations that were being implemented. So it was difficult to make as a decision, but later on after going to the report after, uh, yes, looking the strategy that we are implement, we say let us hold on for a moment and see what the strategies are leading to and therefore see how this is going to help us to fill up the gaps that were not filled by the strategy that we put into place. 
Interviewer: So when did you start implementing these national strategies?

Respondent: implementing them. Yes. I remember, I think it was in January 2021 when we started the with the DNO And at that time, I don't think I knew even about the PPP yes, the first time I ate, came to my knowledge yes, we were in a meeting and they called me and they told me, do you know this, the lab management PPP? I said, no, I don't know about it. They give me a quite huge report to go and read about and, yes, that's how it came to my knowledge. But yes, that was like, like in April or something. Okay. And we had already started implementing other strategies.

Interviewer: So meaning you were not there during the PPP negotiation and when they were at the design and coming up with different options?

Respondent: No, actually I started my position in December last year and I think that work, was accomplished before. Okay. And the time I started the report was in out yes.

Question 5.
Interviewer:  So who were the institutions, what institutions or people persons were involved in this design negotiation?

Respondent: I'm not sure. I don't have all the information but I think yes, I think the national reference lab at that level was involved, but I'm not sure I'm not sure who and who were involved, but I think as far as lab is involved, I think, maybe at different levels that I'm not sure of, but I think the lab had to be involved at that time. Who knows maybe even the department, but I realized that people had more information were at the level of the ministry, the ministry? Yes. And they were the one with the report. They are the one who are following that, the PPP.
 
Interviewer: What about partners?

Respondent:  I think CHAI was involved as well in the PPP I'm not sure, but about other partners, I'm not sure having the information.

Question 6.
Interviewer: What is the institution that is ultimately responsible for approving PPP project?

Respondent: I think that will be the ministry to endorse the PPP for us we can maybe recommend us, technical team, whether this is going to help us. It's not going to help, or this can be improved to make it more efficient.
 
Question 7.
Interviewer:   So the first question is looking at the options that were considered during the design of the PPP what are these options?

Respondent: there is the lab co-management PPP, and the sample transportation PPP I don't really remember. I think there were three.

 Interviewer: So this model do you think that they deviate from any regulatory norms or they can't fit into the norms that we have in the country?

Respondent: I think they have to fit. I think it's not optional, I think they have to fit into the regulations and as far as, the options that, where they were proposed, I think they were fitting into the regulations and norms. That the only challenge I think, was not about the norms far as we see that it makes an impact. The norms were actually okay with the PPP and the regulations .

Interviewer:  So do you think that option of co-management, does it fit into the norms that we have, the regulations that we have framework that we have, and there is nothing that can go against that?

Respondent: I think this is a new framework, it's a new framework that was actually to be explored and this is actually one of the things that brought in actually that hesitancy people are not used to have the public institution, partnering with the private, but I believe that yes, the private sector has something to offer, to bring to the public institutions that is worth to explore.
 
Question 8.
Interviewer: So, if you look at the design that were discussed and the one that was maybe recommended, how is it appropriate to the local context?

Respondent: Yeah. I think a better approach is for it to be implemented is to first of all know what are the gaps that are in the public sector and highlight what is the PPP bringing to fill up the gaps? So if these approach is well elaborated, so the PPP will be appropriate. I think the PPP, needs to be flexible to the needs, the actual needs of the system. This is the only way to make it appropriate. And I think bringing in a private partner will depend on those spaces that we can see into the system where the private will come and fit in.So and if the private can't really evaluate what how a system is working and what are those gaps, and then yes, there will be that collision. It won't be able to fit. But if they have managed to identify the gaps and say, yes, we're bringing this to fill up this gap. So that's the only way to make it appropriate, and this will be appropriate. And I think the flexibility is actually key to make it, yes, they will need to make it fluid to make sure that it feels in the gap. This is there it's going to be appropriate, but it's going to depend on the approach that they will take. 
Interviewer:  You read the report, actually, maybe you were not being part of all these discussions, do you see anywhere a place where this was not going to work?  the way the options were framed, maybe there is a place where maybe it was going to be difficult to implement that. 
What are those area that you, you identified and what we need to require to improve to be able to fit more into the context that we have?

Respondent: Yes.  I can take an example when, we were reading through the lab co-management PPP.  So it wasn't clear enough, at which extent it goes and the question were, the government has done this so far. Are we going to put all of this into the hands of the private partner and, how is going to, yes, we have all the equipment. So all the infrastructures, if we put them in the hands of a private, will it be appropriate or what will be now, that partnership be looking like, what is the efforts so far done by the, by the government to deliver  the services at that table will be, will be considered. So there were so many questions around, because I think it wasn't clear enough at which extent and how this is going to be implemented. So there were so many questions around that actually.  We're not clear enough. And therefore, the hesitancy of course.
  
Interviewer:  Do you think that when discussing about PPP, what are the stakeholders that should sit around the table to come up with a good PPP model?

Respondent: I think, actually all the stakeholders we need to sit down and see what is the current situation? What are the gaps?  What is the contribution and their stakeholder fill up the gap and what can be a better approach to move on. And this needs to not only the management of the lab, not only the management of, or even nature of health, but everyone who's involved.

Interviewer: Can you list these people that you're saying, okay, institutions, when you say everyone, especially in, in the lab sector?

Respondent: Lab, like we, we can say let's say starting from the management of the lab, going up to the management of biomedical services department,  the management RBC  itself, the clinical service department in ministry health, and even people representing the ministry level,  should be involved. And they, they will be also because it's an investment kind of thing they also have to be  RDB in this, because they will need to, to also make a decision, whether there is that investor coming in or this investment that is to be happening. And they will be yes, other partners, you can say CDC, WHO, CHAI, USAID.  yes, all those partners that we work with, in our daily basis to improve the quality of service in the network, they need to sit down and see what has been done. Uh, what is the current situation? What is a better way to move forward?  

Interviewer: What would be your recommendations, in a way of improving how the process was undertaken?

Respondent: Yes the first recommendation is, you remember when I, I say that I, it came to my knowledge when I was having meeting at the ministry. I think a better approach is to start with those implementers who are actually us get the management of the lab involved, get the lab involved and is actually being proposed. Those are the ones actually trying to implement all the strategies that maybe even the policies for coming from the ministry. So getting them involved makes, they collected information even more accurate and even easily understood and implemented later alone. So starting for that low level, actually, I believe that makes all the times when it comes to implementation the work even easier. Because I remember I'm seeing this. Because when I go the report, I come and present it to the directors, no one knew about the PPP and the directors in the different units.Even myself who was not there at that time, it was hard to tell them this has been done. And these are the gaps of observed and yet themselves who are implementing what is involved all the time. So I believe that starting from that lowest level possible, you know, those people are the ones implementing all the strategies. It'll be easier later on to come after and say, these are the, the gaps that you identified. We worked for and this a report out, and that the recommendations it'll be very easier for them to implement. And this has happened with the DNO, which is being smoothly implemented. Because it started with the lowest level they knew about what are the recommendation or the issues and how it's going to, to help develop the jobs. So the, the same works actually, if it is done that way, it's going to be easier for even implementing it. 
 

Question 9.
Interviewer: How would an ideal PPP design accommodate the needs of priority populations in Rwanda?

Respondent: When I look into the health system and or even service delivery, all I think is ideal is to increase the access of, or services by decentralizing the services to the lowest level possible. So, the best PPP should actually act in that direction where we have the population down there, able to access the and best on the services, the bigger, the package of tests possible to the lowest level, instead of all the time, getting a and say these tests are not, we are not able to do them. You need to go to another level, and see most of the patients will lose, will lose them in that way of referring them. And later on, we get them very sick and even not able to even put them anymore, why it was preventable if that this were done down there even before the case, wasn't so decentralizing and increasing the access of services, it's all priority and it's key to the quality of services.
 
Interviewer: So now when you look at the final proposal we have for the AHDP and then compared it to the ideal one that you are thinking of where are the differences, where are the gaps that we have?


Respondent: I think we will need again, to rework the PPP even the proposals or different options of what the PPP is, because it wasn't clear for me, including me so it was really hard to tell, how this is going to benefit the population. It wasn't really easy to integrate into the existing system due to that limited, I think, understanding of the report itself or the PPPs as a whole.  This comes in again the involvement of the implementers, those who are supposed to implement the technical people who are supposed actually to support the PPP if they support it. So it's hard really to tell when you, it's not very clear.
  
Question 10.
Interviewer: How will the PPP design address key considerations to improve access to lab diagnostics?              

Respondent: I think okay. I don't have the model that we recommended to me but I think the best model should actually, befitting with the priorities, the strategies that we are talking about, if we are talking about let's say, talking about with the priorities to centralize the test, uh, even if it involved, for example, to place it, the POC point of care machines, let's say the PPP should come in as yes. As a yes. Is a private partner, but responding to the needs highlighted? So if we are now talking about decentralizing, those tests, and centralizing these labs, the PPP should actually go in that direction. These are the key consideration.   Actually, the model that was proposed when we looked into it, we saw that there was at the same time, other strategy that are moving on being put into place. So marrying the two at that time, but I think the issue was not marrying them the two, because, but may be the issue may have been we have had all the strategies put into place. We have everything and the government is ready to invest. Now PPP how it's going to now come in and are we going to withdraw the government efforts and put the private efforts to make sure that this happened?  That actually was the question. Actually, when we started looking at the PPP, the solution that the PPP was bringing in we realized that we have already started implementing the same study.
  

Interviewer:  So if I understood, well, what you are saying is that I actually, this design was addressing a consideration that you had already started working on through the national strategies. 
Respondent: Yes Okay. So that's why I said maybe we will need to rework on the proposal and the combination of the PPP to make sure that it's actually, they are updated to the actual gaps now that are existing. Okay. Not repeating or duplicating what is being done but also to see what is done, what is not, covered yeah. With the efforts, put into place and start filling the gaps with the PPP.
  
Question 11.
Interviewer: What are the factors that change the discussion around the AHDP PPP?

Respondent: Again, it's going to be hard for me to answer because I was not there for the discussion that was done before, but there was that limited level of involvement and therefore understanding of the PPP the level implementers it was like something that was done when I came in and something that was understood by at the high level, but the lowest level wasn't to be involved enough. So this is one, two is, when we looked into the ways going to be implemented, starting from the part that is not, clear for us, what's meant to impact on even if the, the access, the quality among the affordability, those pillars of good service were clear, were very clear, but it wasn't, um, it wasn't clear enough for the implementers, how it's going to be done. And, and if we are engaging the partners to invest in our health sector to improve the health, , service delivery, we couldn't really understand how the PPP and the equals of the government and the partners are going to  marry each other to make, this service delivery improved.  I think, there was that clarity of information, which was not actually good enough to, to clear the point that were raised.
  
Interviewer: What is the type of information that you wanted to be more sure of? What is the missing information that you would like to have, to understand better?

Respondent: A lab actually has let's say three big departments, let's say they are human resources, there are infrastructures, and there is finance too to make that actually everything operates. So, the staff that we have currently started from the staff are people who are on structure, the structure of the marital structure. And there are those that are brought by the projects want structure. So, we were saying if the private partner comes in is going to take over the staff and everything, and there was no answer to that. For example, the equipment that is existing, if the private partner comes in, is the partner going to hire the equipment and buy the reagent for the equipment and run the services, maybe pay the government or the government, pay the partner. So, they were those many questions that I think were not clear enough and touching all the, all the aspects of the lab, going to the procurement, even itself.  we know the procurement how it is done all the channels that we all followed regulations and all of that, if we bring in the private partner, how is going to change, how is going to be impacted. So, I think all those levels, when it comes to information, they were not actually well elaborated, and there were so many questions that were remaining unanswered. 

Interviewer: Did you get the chance to ask those questions in maybe any meetings or forum to get more clarifications on this small specific?

Respondent: We had to like two or three meetings at the ministry. And all those questions that I'm asking were asked by many other people, and they remained not satisfied with the what actually the answers. I think this comes actually, I'm not blaming the high level, but I believe that as not being the technical people, even the level of embracing or understanding where, how this is going to be happening is it can also be challenging for them. But when it comes to these people at the lowest level who are on the field, who understand the needs, who understand the gaps. It's very easy for them to highlight the point to propose solutions to the issues that they're facing, but was coming from up to down. What I believe should go down to up. So when it comes to, from up to down, could not understand it's difficult for them to even embrace and implement.
  

Question 12.
Interviewer: If AHDP is providing technical support and facilitating financing for the PPP how will the availability of this support affect the PPP design?

Respondent: It'll depend again, on when we talk about financing, what actually, which one is going to be financed. And at which extent the finance can come in and say, I'm supporting half of staff. Let's say half of staff, to improve the, to improve the system, but yes, this can be a support maybe, but not solving the problem. Yeah. So it depends on actually how the financing is going to be even flexible to the needs even. Specifically to be flexible to the needs.I think there are of things that we think financially need support in the lab network. This actually, we can talk about infrastructures when you talk about infrastructures, come in the even equipment. And lot of that  having the PPP  which is by those loans as well, to make sure that this is well implemented  will bring in again you know, when we implement each and every strategy, or if we are moving to a given approach, we all the time think about the sustainability. So again, when it comes to helping the PPP implemented to make it better implemented, we are relying on loans. Again comes in that issue of sustainability.So we will need to rework to see how actually the financial aspect is helping us to implement well, but also once withdrawn how the sustainability will be for them. is it a private who is operating in the public network, but with the support but after that support is the government able to sustain the services deliver maybe by private but later on it's a private who is already there with the support, maybe with the government also bringing in, because there was that issue where we were saying, okay, we are bringing these people, but it's government, who's going to invest at the end, it'll the government? So yes, there is that way of making the work easier, but what's the role of the government during and after. So these issues actually need to be well highlighted, not only to see how the financials going to be impacted, they well, the, the best way of implementing it, it also the best way to sustain it.   

Question 13.
Interviewer:  when you look in the country what we have in place, legal framework and all the policies that we have regulatory frameworks are they supportive of PPP?

Respondent: My knowledge of private and laws and I'm not, I don't have all the information, getting the laws that govern the PPP as more of technical societies from the lab, but it's going to be able to answer to the question,  but I think the people from, the legal office can answer the best to the question, the office of the lab. We don't have a legal office. Yes. We have a legal, legal office.  who can say, okay, we have these laws and laws who govern the, the private partners who are coming in.? So yes, they can go into that much bigger than I.

Question 14. 
Interviewer:   And so let's discuss then if you can describe different earlier, for example, experiences that you have projects in country, in lab, any other experience in public private partnerships in Rwanda?

Respondent: Yes. You have had Abbott as a PPP and a report that was released by, was it a third party in maybe supported by CHAI I think the report that was out the feasibility report was proposing three different options and those three different options the government was losing.  This was from the beginning, a PPP that was implemented very fast. and, and when we evaluated during the feasibility to study, we realized that the three options that we were offering, they were saying, if you are given the reagent for free , the government will be losing. If we continue, if we buy the, if we, we give you the reagent for free, you reduce the staff of lab by half, the government will still lose. The third was, if we give you the reagent for free, we reduce the staff by half, and you consolidate we create a new network. They were talking about any of those   still the government lose, meaning that in any of the options that you choose you lose. So you ask yourself, why am I in the PPP?
 
Interviewer:  Then you said that you had some PPP with Abbott. Can you explain how it worked? So what was exactly this PPP Abbott?

Respondent: Again, I don’t have all the details, but what I have as details that they had to place the equipment and run, the tests and the government, the procurement would be buying. It was a placement kind of contract, and the government would be buying everything. And later on, when they,  they have  the feasibility study shows that, uh, this placement, this way of working with the government by procuring everything for the government works, they will even build what they have called a center of excellence and all of that. It was a, quite a huge project. I don't know how before the negotiations were, or when they started the implementation, what was the, what were the ground rule?  but yes, it was revealed that it's not working. Okay. It's not really working. So this was not a very good experience with that PPP.
 

Interviewer: How trusting is the relationship between public and private sectors for health based on the past experience?

Respondent: I think there's no issue with the trust. Actually only issue would be what are you bringing on the table which is going to improve. That's actually the main, um, the main issue cause have been working with the partners. We have BABLY which is operational and giving services to Rwandans and highly appreciated them. So there's no issue with the trust. The issue is what are you bringing to fill up what we can see as a gap We can set a gap where we can, we have been approach by different partners. And there is another one, another private, company who, who is actually tried to present, some of proposals or solutions. And they call themselves lab at home, for us. It's very interesting. Because these people are to be reaching people to where they are. For example, I'm here in my office and I'm diabetic, let's say, and I all the time, let's say do my blood.Because let's say weekly basis. And I don't have time, have a lot to do. I will only call them or maybe use app and say, I'm at RBC. And I want to do a blood sugar. They will come in my office, take my blood, take it to a lab where that blood can be analyzed and give me a result without me going to cure in CHUK or for the whole day waiting for the sample to be taken and wait for another day for getting results. So it's a very good approach, which is actually, we are looking at as innovative if they were able to, to implement that, actually they would be very work on those partners. So this is actually to tell you that there is no any issue as trust is concerned.
 
Question 15.
Interviewer: We are looking at the historic investment and interest from government in lab?

Respondent: One of the priorities of our sector is to increase the accessibility. As I said, of services to the population down there, the national strategies, for the lab as well, go in those directions as they're highlighted by the priorities of health sector, therefore, as I said, we are looking at how can we increase the primary health care access to those people? So that's when  at the level of the lab, we are thinking about decentralizing, the test we are thinking about using the point care machines we are thinking about increasing the packages of tests to health centers and health posts. We are thinking about increasing, the accessibility of our digital systems to those lowest level so that they can, we can be able to collect even information and the to feed in our systems, the data that will help us to even monitor and even improve those services that are actually provided in those different levels. This is the one example that I'm taking to show how actually we also align with the priorities of health sector among many that exist.

  Interviewer: What is the profile of health workers that are working in the lab diagnostic system in Rwanda?

Respondent: We have the level of A2   those who did the lab long back in the secondary school, and they have a two, we have those who are, again, upgraded to the level A1. And we have those who have the level A0, which is a bachelor's degree. And I think on the structure, I think we do not have, the levels of, of masters to the, in the labs. I think it's up to the bachelor's degree. Maybe lab comes in when it comes to management. And these people have trainings in general laboratory sciences.

 
Question 16.
Interviewer: Who are the key stakeholders in the PPP and why do you think these people or institutions are involved?

Respondent: Starting from the ministry and RBC these are key stakeholders that have to be there. Because they're the key implementers. They're the one coming up with the priorities and policies for health sector for the GoR institutions, including ministry of finance and planning is important because we talked about in the financial aspect of the PPP. So it's important to bring them in to ensure that this part is also elaborated and we will be able to get what we expect from it, the RDB is important because it's the RDB is in charge of the investors who are coming in the country. So all the decision that involve, an investor already be easier, the time he is involved the procurement agency cause of the procurement aspect of it, and is also to be there.
We do all the procurement of supplying agency also through RMS. So it's important as well, to bring in RMS to make sure that actually all the processes and approaches that we decide as part of the PPP concern actually adhere with, uh, the regulations of procurement, uh, the medical supplies, uh, cause RMS is our procurement entity. So yes, it should be involved, um, private procurement supplier, which is a BOOFMAR here. We are talking about a private partner so, uh, BOOFMAR is important because, I think it'll be the one to work with the private partner now, cause the RMS is a procurement entity of the ministry health, or the medical supply that ministry buys within drugs and reagent and everything goes  through RMS. But the private partner, I think will be having an equivalent entity, which I think can be in this case BOOFMAR, but all of this can be part of the discussion. See a better way maybe later on we can decide we use still RMS instead of BOOFMAR so it'll be, I think it's in debate, private laboratories should involve too.So we can have this private labs but for the continuum care of our patients, maybe this also can come in. Cause it's all it's that actually objective the continuum care. Okay. The patients. So yes, we can have them the public health insurance, RSSB of course, because here comes in and everything, the private health insurances, cause they're the ones who are going to endorse the tariffs and everything, the public hospitals, of course WHO they have to be there, the high learning institution University of Rwanda. I think it's also an important partner to also be there.
  
Interviewer: So the next question, when you look at this list, we want to know how these different institutions, who, how do they perceive the, the advantages and disadvantages with the PPP?

Respondent:  I'm not them, but I'm going to try to put my feet in their shoes, I think each and everyone wants, starting with the public, to go back to the private, facilities that we work with. And again, looking into the role of the partners as CDC among these, all of these actually should actually embrace see how the highlighted gaps to be paid by the PPP are actually approached. And having the stakeholders like the bridge, or they can say, okay, we have these gaps, we are able to fill in these gaps, CDC. We are able to fill in these gaps and so on and there remain gaps. So the PPP maybe let says, start with the financial aspect of it. If we had to take a loan, it has taken a loan that we fill up this gap, because we're not able to fill this gap.So this is an example I'm taking from the, from the partners as WHO, CDC among others we can say RMS, we have we are the procurement entity, but when it comes to the cash flow, we are not comfortable. Maybe getting the loan that will increase the cash flow will help us  to give you, better services kind of thing for the public hospitals, they can say we have these facilities, but the equipment’s that we have are not adequate to deliver the packages, assigned to us by Al health, which  have other equipment’s. So the PPP. So I think this is a kind of, uh, but it's debatable and it's going to be so depending on the gaps, of course, that can be highlighted at that moment when it comes. But I think each and every department actually needs to be involved to make sure that we approach it as a whole in a holistic way.

Interviewer: And then how threatening to the success of the PPP is the, a potential for turnover in key position among national actors?

Respondent: For me, I have never been afraid of the turnover, because all the time I tell people, I train this staff in the lab, for example, to do this test. If she moves to another lab, I'm not losing. Cause she's serving another one on the other side and yet the trainings are not worse in a time. It's a continuous thing. So I haven't, seen anything like a threat, or a turnover itself as a threat. Yeah.  You know, because the person is moving it's from one institution to another and if he's not serving here he's serving there is a gap he's feeling and the training that I have planned its continuous, even if there's someone new, the person will be trained  immediately directly through trainings or would be mentorship of the colleagues
  
Interviewer: How threatening is it the turnover to the PPP process itself? 


Respondent: The turnover to the PPP process.  I think the PPP, as you said, is going to be a process to implement it and the turnover you can't stop it in any way. There will be a turnover. Yeah. For that to be a threat to the PPP. I think, I don't think that can be a threat, I don't think because the PPP is an approach, which is a system based and when something, when an approach is a system based, it can be easily disrupted by a turnover unless if the system changes the directions

Interviewer: can you maybe explain that more like the system change, what you mean by the system change?

Respondent:  The system changed here. I mean the shift in priorities. That can impact on the PPP, if the direction is clear and people have embraced the approach, the PPP, I think turnover shouldn't be a threat.  But I think it should actually, as I said, feel as also that as an opportunity it should appear to the PPP as an opportunity, again to fill up the gaps, which are existing. And I said, if someone moved to another place, they have someone new, you are training and transferring skills to a new person but the first is not lost. He's still operating in the network. so he's filling a gap in one way or the other.

Question 19.
Interviewer:  So then the next question is how interested are private partners in participating in PPP?
Respondent: That's a good question, but I'm not able to answer because, I’m not part of the private sector, but I think each and every partner private sector from the private sector, um, yes, they can feel really,  attracted by the public by the issues, with the public. Is that compared to the private, private, actually it's manageable? It's very flexible, but when it comes to, to the public is well regulated and rigid. So, uh, marrying the two actually requires the private to be flexible enough to, to fit in the public.There are many aspect. So that financially, when it comes to regulations and rules many details may have factors actually come in but I think yeah, sometimes they're attracted other times. They're not really attract due to all those challenges that they face with when it comes to work with the public. What are the, so you, you, for example, you, you listed, um, the rigidity of the public system. Yeah. It's and,
  
Interviewer:  What are the other factors that may limit the private sector working with the government in the public apart from having  like very rigid system, following regulations?
Respondent: I think actually everything actually reside around this, around this and if this, so the privates were regulated, were structured and most of the time, you know, with the private, they want to move very fast and they find their flexible ways, which is not all the time, the kids for the public and for them, they perceive the public as delaying them in their race. 
Interviewer: What are the incentives for the private sector to work with the public system, to participate in a PPP in the country?

Respondent: I think I can say the existing gaps, there are gaps that we all know being in public for being in private and those gaps yes, and they attract the private sector, they attract the public sector and if they manage actually to work through the process to fill up the gaps, actually yes, they make also their interests into that. Yes. We have had examples. We have BABLY I talked about, there's another one that I'm talking, which is lab at home which has a very innovative idea. I think as lab we have embrace and we really even encourage them to present to them, to, to present the idea to the ministry. Yes, by looking to the gaps, some are interested with innovative ideas and they just died in there.
 
Interviewer: When you look at the private partners that we have in country that are, what in laboratory diagnostic, do you think that they have the capacity to participate in a PPP with the government?  

Respondent: I'm not sure but I think they are. When I look at what are the services that we offer different labels and what are the volumes and what are people outside there in terms of volumes who needs the services and how frequent  they go to the private, I think they can be, some private  partners that can actually but when I look at for example, BMC, which does those special tests maybe that we aren't able to do for the moment  and what was proposed in the model the model was actually building that kind capacity that we not have, so that we deliver everything that we have we need to deliver. But BMC is a lab, which is separate operating as a private lab to which we may refer. It is so would you yes. It's yes, they can, they can contribute at the, at a given level.  May be not at the level that we may wish them to, to contribute, but I think yes, to the certain level. 
Interviewer: So do you think that these private partners that we have in country, if they're provided with more fundings, if they can really provide the support needed for a PPP?

Respondent: I'm looking into this, how this can be done. we have loans the government, uh, that is going to inject in the private labs to make sure that they provide the service to the population that the government is trying to make sure that it is covered by public, so that for the private, they can do it, they can do it. But the challenge with the public is all times with the tariffs and how they're covered by the  to protect them to down there so they can do it, but the issue remains, are we at the level of the primary care to them to down there to the population are  we  giving him access to all the tests? They can maybe build infrastructures, equip them the state of arts technology, but if the tariffs very high and not covered by the RSSB, they not receive the service. So I'm looking into the way of how it keeps working with the government who understands the quality of the services to the population and who is able to mobilize the funds to make sure that tariff goes down increasing the access of the service. that's actually, how I look at it, even if I know that those private companies can do it but now the question is, okay how is it accessible? How is it affordable to down there as actually comes in as an issue?

Question 20.
Interviewer:  looking at scale up and sustainability, especially when looking at, when discussing around the PPP design. So the question is what are, or could be the plans in place to support public sector financing of diagnostics in the future?

Respondent: the plans to ensure that the private sector services are sustained financially. This is actually, I think I raise the same question when I was discussing about how now, the sustainability of the PPP it was a question that we all, even ourselves I'm surprised that you also ask a question. Because we were thinking, we are saying, okay, we have a private partner coming into partner with the public. If there is a long sustaining or making the things run when the loan will be withdrawn, is the government able to sustain the private partner? to be sure that the good service that we have seen delivered is sustained. So there was that aspect, I think that was not maybe elaborated well in the report that will also ask ourselves in any way, the government will invest. If it will invest if the government is to invest, is this going to be sustainable? Because we all the time say limited funds and we have to work with the partner. So if we bring in this private partner at the beginning, sustained by a loan or a given amount, once the loan is exhausted or was withdrawn, we need the service to be sustained. So this is a question we ask ourselves, but I don't have an answer for you right now this is also a question I ask myself, is  the government after they have looked into  what involves, in terms of finance, going to be able to sustain this
all the time. 
Interviewer: So currently, what are the different sources of financing for lab diagnostics?

Respondent: There is government but also partners, which is different.  when we talk about the private sector because we are not yet to the level that we say we are done with the public facilities. It has now been strengthened by financing, from the private sector. We are not at that level. yes, because we are working, we are still improving that was my question for the public sector, because we're looking mainly for the public sector, public sector. So how is it going to be finance it's mainly through government and yes. And private partners. 
Interviewer: Then if you look at your, your financing plans that you have are they sustainable?

Respondent: I can't say that we are at the level of sustaining everything without any partner first of all, because all the times we are still building the health system and we need to work with partners cause of different reasons, to improve and also to be able to benchmark what we have  with other exposures through the partners so yes, we are not able to, we, we are not yet at the level of say that we can self-sustain. We still need the partner to work with the partners and the aim for each and everything that we do when we come up with these strategies of generating income is to see how we can move forward to that level of sustainability. But I can say that we answer it there. There's still a lot to work on to make sure that actually we reach that state.

 Question 21.
Interviewer: So is there anything else that you would like to discuss about PPP that we have not talked about?

Respondent: When I started I wasn't aware of the PPP because I was new. I was joining the system but didn't people that I joined. They were not really, at this level of the lab, the level of involvement wasn't at the satisfactory level. So one of the recommendations, because I think these people will happen maybe not today, but let's say the future. You, so let's start with the, with the lowest level. Well, these are people who are going to, to implement the PPP we have talking about. So we start by the lowest level. And, um, as you said, bottom up to make sure that actually we move with the whole package of the needs that people understands them and the way to fill up, to overcome them to the highest level. So this is one, important recommendation that I have been making when it comes to this PPP that I would like also to share.  

Interviewer: Thank you very much for your willingness to participate. I have took you really a very good time for your day. And, as I stated at the beginning, if the PPP move ahead to contracting, we will conduct a second round of interview. And if you agree, we may reach out again in the next few months to schedule another interview with you to see what to capture the new perspective, according to the development. Thank you very much. 

Respondent: Thank you too.
