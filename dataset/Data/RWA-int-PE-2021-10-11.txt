Question 1. 
•Interviewer: Please describe your role as it relates to laboratory diagnostics in Rwanda

•Respondent: I am Director General of District Hospital, my role as a leader of a district hospital, we have a laboratory like any other general hospital and we supervise 15 health centers that have basic diagnostic laboratory tests that they take. So the part of my job is to oversee all the health activities in the area, including laboratories from primary level to secondary level.

Question 2. 
•Interviewer: Are you familiar with the African Health Diagnostics Platform currently being discussed in Rwanda?  

•Respondent: No, it is my first time to hear it

Question 3. 
•Interviewer: From your standpoint, what are the key issues that a PPP or any contracting modalities aiming to improve laboratory diagnostic services should focus on, or include, to be successful? 

•Respondent: (With attitude of Smiling), PPP I have a clue on what it is in general, and I would think if it has to be applied in our sittings (health sectors), there is a broad complex of discussions that should be taken care of including;
First, procurement process, how investors or private patterns can acquire access into public institutions to invest and run the investment of laboratory.

Second, the partnership , how can it look like? who is going to manage the laboratory? what capacity at what level?, cost modalities? if  it happens you come here to take our laboratory, are you going to continue to charge the way we charge, are you going to consider the clients we have? And their ability to pay? All those should be put under consideration to be able to establish a sustainable PPP.
Question 3 c. 
•Interviewer: What do you think about contextual factors, 

•Respondent: I think at this stage, the health sector in Rwanda considering policy engagement, the desire to improve, the ability of public finances to upgrade laboratories to the extent of being very good diagnostic institutions, obviously, the desire is there and to whoever wants to play a role in improving the quality of services I think is welcome. The issue would be;
1.How is it going to be done?
2.How much should be invested in?
3.What would be the return on investment? For how long? Those are issues that people should discuss on that includes insurance, Out of pocket payments how much people can afford to pay depending on the investment that has put in place and how those collections are going to be divided between the hospitals and investors. 

Question 4. 
•Interviewer: What are the costs and benefits of pursuing a PPP or any contracting modalities for laboratory diagnostics at this time?

•Respondent: (With sureness attitude), at this time we have clients, people want the available services, the habit of health seeking behaviors have changed overtime in Rwanda , second the tariffs that the insurance companies are offering, that is something that  should be looked at , and the amount of investment that should be put in place. I am quite sure if someone has to invest, the people who are going to consume services are available as long as it is not straining his/her financial capacity because our community is still poor, so we need to look at the good standards of the services but which are affordable.

Question 5. 
•Interviewer: How supportive is the existing policy, legal and regulatory framework for PPPs / contract modalities? 

•Respondent: (With the attitude of happiness), I would dwell much on existing atmosphere, not exactly policy but policies are in place including the PPP policy that the government of Rwanda have established. In RDB they follow up on that on big investments, long term investments, and the whole process around it. But also I have seen partnership with ministry of health, an example of ABBOTT Diagnostics the way they manage some laboratories that atmosphere, I think it is favorable for any other further discussion and for any further PPP investment.

Question 5 b. 
•Interviewer: How flexible is the PPP or contract modalities to changes in government or government priorities? 
•Respondent: (With attitude of shaking the head confused), for now I am not in position to measure how flexible it is because the typical PPP model that we know that is happening between the government and investors especially in big investment like in energy and other investment, it is not quite easy to be implemented in health currently, but we need to discuss how it can be adopted to the situation we are in.  

Question 6. 
•Interviewer: Historically, how have public and private sectors focusing on health interacted?

•Respondent: I think until recent, there have been parallel  mode of business, where private has been purely private and public as well, private being investment for profit making and public being not for profit but for social investment, I think that has been the history. But now if we want to join the two we need to think about how those two components would come together, investment with profit intentions at the same time thinking about social benefit of the community on public investment.

Question 6 a.
•Interviewer: How trusting, collaborative is the relationship?
•Respondent: The relationship it has been parallel and at policy level they have been managing the two separately in the same sector which I am not in position to measure the relationship how it is whether it is good or bad, but what is important is that the services have been provided to the public. 

Question 6 c. 
•Interviewer: What other, earlier experiences or projects have there been in-country that can provide lessons to improve laboratory diagnostics.

•Respondent: (With sureness attitude), specifically for the laboratory the example of ABBOTT can be enumerated but am not sure how it works because we don’t have it here, but you can also look at other public projects that private investors has been conducting with government. 

Question 7. 
•Interviewer: How will health system governance arrangements (e.g., decentralization, devolution) affect the PPP design or contract modalities and pre-tender process?

•Respondent: (With the attitude of happiness), that is a very good thinking direction because decentralization in Rwanda, local government, community are the very key important to think about, because without focusing on those you can’t talk about PPP. The community has to be involved and give their views on what they desire to have and   be able to commit if they are able to pay or to consume the services.

Question 8. 
•Interviewer: What has been the historic investment and interest from government in laboratory diagnostics? 

•Respondent: (With sureness attitude), I think the government has been interested in improving and standardizing laboratory services, if you look at national laboratory how it performs, and how the referral laboratories are being monitored and supported, the evaluations of SLMTA(Strengthening Laboratory Management Toward Accreditation) and others that are putting laboratories in accreditations. But still for a laboratory to function well they require a huge investment (if you look at any referral hospitals with specialized doctors, these hospitals need a standardized laboratory with well-trained laboratory technicians, equipment and consumables). This may strain the government to have enough money to invest in laboratories .the community is supposed to be able to pay for those services so that they can be sustainable.


Question 9.
•Interviewer: Who are key stakeholders that should be involved in developing the PPP or contracting modalities and why?  

•Respondent: This is a broad question it starts at the global level WHO should involve in giving guidelines to the government, at the national level the MoH should put in place favorable conditions and policies that help the investors and also help the public to assist the services (health insurance and setting up tariffs that are conducive to both public and private), at sub national level we have district the local government to understand and be involved to mobilize the community services at the community level. The community have to be able to understand the needs and be able to pay, just to adjust the premium of the insurances. 

Question 10.
•Interviewer: What is the relative influence of these actors on negotiations of this nature? 

•Respondent:(With attitude of shaking the head), the negotiation should start on the higher level on agreement of setting a condition where the stakeholders are able to benefit and they should set tariffs that are conducive for both sides ( the communities and implementers).  These communities and implementers need to be informed and get involved in upgrading our standards to the required level and also community should be ready to consume the services.

Question 11.
•Interviewer: Whose interests are helped or hurt by laboratory diagnostics happening in the public vs. the private sector? 

•Respondent:  I think everyone starting from the policy makers, implementers and consumers are interested or hurt when the services are not at the level we want but the most affected are the primary beneficiaries (patients), but of course patients get what we have prepared for them.

Question 11 a.
•Interviewer: Who would benefit the most from a joint public-private venture or contract modalities in laboratory diagnostics? 
•Respondent: (With attitude of smiling), I think everyone should benefit, especially the communities for instance they travel away to get the services they should have had close to them.

Question 11 b.
Interviewer: Who do you think would be potentially threatened by the PPP or contract modalities arrangement and why? 

Respondent: I think no one would be threatened.



Question 12.
Interviewer: How interested do you think private partners might be in participating in the PPP or contract modalities? 

Respondent: (With attitude of happiness), private partners should understand that there is big market, the interest will not be gained in overnight, we need a long term investment and set of activities that will slowly generate profits but it will be steady and it will be profitable for a long time.

Question 12 c.
Interviewer: Do you think that private partners working in laboratory diagnostics in-country have the capacity to participate and deliver on the PPP or contract modalities? Why/why not? 

Respondent:(With attitude of confusion), for now am not sure on the local market, if we have the capacity and expertize to do that, but I guess out there, there are people who are interested and who have got the capacity to do it, if the profits are there even people   beyond the borders can come and invest and get profits. 

Question 13.
Interviewer: How could the PPP be designed or contract modalities be designed to achieve scale-up and sustainability? 

Respondent: I think there should be negotiations between the health sector and private investment, and also RDB that oversees the investment in Rwanda and come up with a model. Recently I think there is no clear model on this partnership and look at all the components that are important in this business model, including the health insurances, the ability to pay and the amount of investment that should be done on each level, this needs a lot of discussions before investing so that we cannot be disappointed if we don’t put all those components into considerations and see how they are going to impact on the business model.

Question 14.
Interviewer: What are the plans in place to support public sector financing of diagnostics in the future? 

Respondent: I think at the policy level, the desire, the political will, the policies are in place though they need to be deeply worked on and I think the market is there, after having, the discussions I mentioned earlier and see which is the standard that can benefit on all of us, if we come up with the idea of how that would look like then we can invest.

Question 14 a.
Interviewer: Which different sources of funding are expected to be used for financing diagnostics? 

Respondent: Well there is what have been existing, government supports, which empowers our own revenues but also if we have to upgrade there should be some sort of private investment, am not sure if the donors could be willing to invest in PPP but if they are there, they are people that have that interest to support the people that are intending to have PPP that would be very good.

Question 15.
Interviewer: Is there anything else you would like to discuss about the PPP or contract modalities that we have not talked about? 

Respondent: (With attitude of convincing), if we want to have a sustainable PPP investment we do not need to rush we have to sit down and discuss, put all the stakeholders on the table and come up with a model which can respond to the needs in Rwanda not just picking something from Ghana or Ethiopia and come and implement it here. We need to look at all parameters
