please describe your involvement in the ppp process or any contract modalities under the ahdp in rwanda. ,"with attitude of happiness , i was the head of biomedical services department at rwanda biomedical center, i had in charge the national reference lab, and overseeing all hospital lab networks, the transfusion services, and medical technology division. i was supervising many activities including activities related to diagnostics and how they will rolled out into our system at the rwanda biomedical center. ",1,rwa-int-pe-2021-10-26-fi
are you familiar with the african health diagnostics platform currently being discussed in rwanda ?,"yes, i heard about it, when chai came with it as a project, to expand what was being considered as a ppp here in rwanda, if i recall what i heard it was meant to help government, to partner with a specific partner on multiple services related to diagnostics to make sure that the government delivers at the standard required by quality health both nationally and internationally.",2,rwa-int-pe-2021-10-26-fi
what was the process of negotiation over ppp/ contract specifics? ,"with attitude of shaking head , there was no contract yet, because the contract comes when the ppp is induced by the government and the contract was to come after the feasibility study was finalized and approved by steering committee.",3,rwa-int-pe-2021-10-26-fi
"what were the sticking points around the ppp/ contract modalities design, and how were they resolved? ","with sureness attitude , in rwanda everything is provided by the law, it is the ppp law of 2016 every design, and every contract has provisions in that law and the ppp is actually negotiated and brought to life by the rwanda development boardrdb .",4,rwa-int-pe-2021-10-26-fi
did negotiations take place as part of existing structures or did a new group/structure have to be established? ,"with sureness attitude , there was no negotiation with anybody, the partner had project, which was reassessed by rbc teams and rdb teams which brought together both the partners at private level and government of rwanda represented by moh/rbc. it was not like there was any negotiation about tender ship or tendering but it was maturing together a project which the government of rwanda would have induced for partnership.",5,rwa-int-pe-2021-10-26-fi
who has been involved in the design of the ppp / contract modalities?,"teams from moh, rbc and rdb",6,rwa-int-pe-2021-10-26-fi
how about chai?,"chai come in not as a negotiator, come in to help and go in depth into the partnership and it has accompanied efforts at the feasibility lever in terms of financing, facilitation and it has never been involved into negotiation.",7,rwa-int-pe-2021-10-26-fi
how did the actors involved in the design process change between the initial design and the final agreement or any current negotiation to refine the design of the ppp/contract modalities?,"no, we were still at the feasibility study level, so before it is completed, there is nothing else that could be done.",8,rwa-int-pe-2021-10-26-fi

have there been any actors trying to propose opposite direction from the main actors working in ppp or contracting modalities?,"with sureness attitude , yes of course you know new initiatives, do not go as smooth as you expect, many people saw into the ppp process, a kind of giving, to one partner the whole procurement of the whole process which is not always welcomed by everyone, so that is a hump already into the negotiation or the contracting of any partner, and i think if things are not well explained far before it might also be a hampering point or a sticking point at any contracting negotiation process.",10,rwa-int-pe-2021-10-26-fi
which institution was / will be ultimately responsible for approving the ppp design / contract modalities? ,"it is provided by the law only the steering committee approves the ppp, and the steering committee is composed of ministry of finance, ministry of infrastructure, rwanda development board and the ministry of health if things are related to health.",11,rwa-int-pe-2021-10-26-fi
what options were or are still being considered when designing the model? ,"with attitude of convincing , there are two models which are possible, but the our options was what is calledbotbuild operate and transferit is the model of ppp which brings the partner in partnershipwith the government to build up the design , the project and operate it and transfer it to government in a negotiated period.",12,rwa-int-pe-2021-10-26-fi
how does the ppp design or contract modalities distribute risks between government and the private sector? ,"with sureness attitude , when you operate you are 100% responsible and accountable to whatever might happen because the model you build is promising the government to do what is in the contract as it has to be done, the government is there to make sure to hold you accountable of what you had promised and contracted to do, so risks are both on side of the partner and the government, if the partner was to fail.",13,rwa-int-pe-2021-10-26-fi
"how does key ppp or ahdp implementation stakeholder committee capacity affect ppp or contract modalities design, tender/procurement and implementation? ","in rwanda every tender-ship or tendering process is provided by the law, if you have a proposal and you are proposing it to the government of rwanda, that proposal is accepted on one condition, that you make a feasibility study, which proves the project to be viable both financially and viable in terms of diagnostics, if you are considering diagnostics.secondly, if the government was to bring forth a project, then it will just put together project, do the feasibility study and tender it to any partner who is willing to partner with the government to bring it to flourish. it is in that direction things related to ppp work here in rwanda.",14,rwa-int-pe-2021-10-26-fi
how about public facility laboratory management capacity at the implementation,"no, the partner would have implemented the contract within the government facilities, that what is the government is bringing into the partnership, we have infrastructures at facility level, equipment, staffing but in terms of managing all of that it was meant that the partner will take over the managements of the labs and any activity at the level of the lab. then the partner negotiate with government what it is bringing back to the government, beyond the usual services as offered by gor, to the hospitals.",15,rwa-int-pe-2021-10-26-fi
how appropriate is the design to the local context?,"with sureness attitude , when you look at the needs, the capacity there is no way the public health will be able alone to deliver the quality health care in diagnostics to have a private partner who is willing to take over and bring at worldwide standards our diagnostics power and capacity it is in the advantage of the government to see it happening, it is actually partnering to deliver quality care and i think the design as it was designed it was the best we could get, hopefully in the future we will see many ppps being signed and contracted for health care delivery.",16,rwa-int-pe-2021-10-26-fi
how does the ppp design / contract modalities accommodate the needs of the priority populations?,"we canâ€™t accommodate any ppp if it has nothing to do with delivering services to our populations, as simple as that.",17,rwa-int-pe-2021-10-26-fi
how well does the ppp design / contract modalities address key considerations to improve access of laboratory diagnostics? ,"with sadness attitude , our capacity in diagnostics, is still low both in our hospitals public and private here in rwanda, you need people who have the knowhow to help pinch in, to bring up capacity and capability of people of lab technicians, so that we can deliver to the level we want as we look forward to see rwanda becoming a health hub.",18,rwa-int-pe-2021-10-26-fi
which consideration is best served by the current design? why?,"the motto of ministry of health is to make sure the health care is accessible both geographically, and financially any ppp which is being considered should deliver to those points, should make health care diagnostics services accessible and should make them affordable, there is no partnership ifany ppp is not delivering those. ",19,rwa-int-pe-2021-10-26-fi
which consideration is currently receiving the least attention in the current design? why? ,"with attitude of confusion , i can say it is availability because the services are not yet that delivered comprehensively in our own hospitals.",20,rwa-int-pe-2021-10-26-fi
what are the perceived costs and benefits of pursuing a ppp or contract modalities for laboratory diagnostics at this time? ,"with sureness attitude , ppp should have existed like yesterday, because it is the only way the government will be able to deliver the quality of services to our people. if it is not to happen then the government will take the whole burden of diagnostics, of training and informing people on its own and i think this is just too big for the government to carry on with all the priorities in other sectors.",21,rwa-int-pe-2021-10-26-fi
"ahdp is providing technical support and facilitating financing for this ppp / contract modalities, how did the availability of this support affect the ppp design or contract modalities? ","with sureness attitude , i donâ€™t think ahdp has yet started delivering any support to rwanda as current.",22,rwa-int-pe-2021-10-26-fi
what are current features of the ppp design / contract modalities that would not be possible without the financial instruments facilitated by ahdp? ,"with attitude of confusion , i think no partnership will be accountable to the contract unless there is availability of finance support both from government and ahdp, because a partner needs guarantee of their own investments, and i think ahdp will be there to guarantee that the service delivered will be paid as the contract says.",23,rwa-int-pe-2021-10-26-fi
"how supportive is the existing policy, legal and regulatory framework for ppps / contract modalities?","with sureness happy face attitude , rwanda is open to do business, when the partnership is to save the rwandan population , our policy are so open, and if there is any law harboring it ,it would be bent just to make surethe partnership happens. with the existence of 2016 law everything, all terms of the law mean to bring forth the partnership with private sector.",24,rwa-int-pe-2021-10-26-fi
how flexible is the ppp or contract modalities to changes in government or government priorities? ,"no ppp canâ€™t be accommodated unless it is aligned with government priorities, because even the private sectors when they come into partnership with the government they want to show that they aligned with government priorities.",25,rwa-int-pe-2021-10-26-fi
"historically, how have public and private sectors for health interacted? ","with attitude of shaking the head , i have no clue of history ",26,rwa-int-pe-2021-10-26-fi

how do the health system governance arrangements affect the ppp design or contract modalities and pre-tender process? ,"with attitude of confusion , perhaps what is lacking now is the moh taking the lead in defining theirneeds in project so that partners know what are their real needs , thebook containing the needs of ministry of health so that they can be implemented in partnership. but when there is no project aligned there then the partner will not know how to go and where to go.",28,rwa-int-pe-2021-10-26-fi
who is accountable for the success of the ppp and what are the important points that define the success? and to whom are they accountable?,"with sureness attitude , in diagnostics it is meant to bring our diagnostics to a well class medical diagnostics, if you can deliver that your partnership is successful. secondly it is meant to be delivering a system that makes rwanda shine on the well stage. third, it is bringing capacity of our technicians to deliver the quality of diagnostics care we wish. four, is to equip our laboratories with equipment that allow that to happen. ",29,rwa-int-pe-2021-10-26-fi
what has been the historic investment and interest from government in laboratory diagnostics?,"with attitude of happiness , the government of rwanda has sank millions of dollars, in diagnostics sectors, but the needs also national wide are bigger than the money perhaps we have and that is why we need partnerships.",30,rwa-int-pe-2021-10-26-fi
how does improvement in laboratory diagnostics align with government priorities for the health sector?,"with attitude of shaking the head , i donâ€™t know how to say it, but we have been constructing ,equipping our laboratories to bring the diagnostics services close to the populations and qualify to the standard of the quality services we want to deliver; any investment in the equipment, in infrastructure was aiming at bringing quality service to the people.",31,rwa-int-pe-2021-10-26-fi
"how has covid-19 affected the ppp design, contract modalities or pre-tender process?","with an upset face , covid-19 has disturbed many things, including the diagnostics but the ppp has put equipments that allowed us to face covid in terms of diagnosing it on decentralized level, so the money which is flowing in to fight covid it is also flowing in for diagnostics and that money is helping to expand the capacity our lab and we hope that whenever covid will fade away, all those equipment, will be used also to diagnose other diseases.",32,rwa-int-pe-2021-10-26-fi
who are key stakeholders in the ppp and why are they involved? ,"with tiredness attitude, the ppp means two partners; the government of rwanda in health represented byrwanda biomedical centerand ministry of health , the steering committee which approves the ppp which includes the ministry of finance, rwanda development board and the ministry of infrastructure. the hospitals facilities as the end users, perhaps the rssb as the public insurance company. we have to know that ppp is a kind of procurement which means has nothing to do with rwanda public procurement agency, perhaps it will have to do with the rwanda medical supply as the medium through which the government does procurement.",33,rwa-int-pe-2021-10-26-fi

whose interests are helped or hurt by laboratory diagnostics happening in the public vs. the private sector? ,"with attitude of shaking the head , i can say there should be no interests helped or hurt, there should be interests in terms of which kind of capacity of diagnostics, which is being brought forward, but we know that income in our hospitals come mostly from our laboratories, and many hospitals might think that a private partner is taking a way their own interests. it is within the government power to negotiate in a way that, if we bring in a partner how will the hospitals survive, that must be thought through as they negotiate their contract.",38,rwa-int-pe-2021-10-26-fi

what are the biggest drawbacks for private partners to participate in the ppp or contract modalities,"with the attitude of assuring , the only drawback it is when the government is not honoring it own contract, so which means if there is no business, then partner will fall.",45,rwa-int-pe-2021-10-26-fi

"please, can you describe your involvement in the public private partnership process under the african health diagnostic platform in rwanda?","thank you very much. i was very much involved in the, ppp between,my employer and the government of rwanda, but that one was not introduced,in the framework of the ahdp because it's an initiative team that was initiated between the two partners, but it was not led by or done through, the ahdp so if am to answer,in relation to what was doneunder ahdp, there is nothing so far but in terms of what my company did or my employer with the government of rwanda,i can demonstrate my involvement. thank you.",1,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"who is your employer? okay so you, you are saying that you are not familiar with african health diagnostic platform, or you have heard about it.","my employer is abbott, i've heard about it and read about it, but the ppp i was involved in was not under ahdp",2,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
what was the process of negotiation of the ppp you are talking about?,"yeah, thank you very much abbott has had an idea of partnering with the government of rwanda to improve, laboratory services and came up with a proposal of better services and a state of the arts instruments to improve diagnostic services in rwandan public laboratories. then, once the proposal was received by the government of rwanda, the cabinet indorsed that idea and the sector ministry, which is ministry of health, go into an engagement with abbott to initiate that partnership with the earlier stage doing the feasibility study as per the ppp law. so, that's how the negotiation initiated actually departed from the proposal abbott did to the government and then they sat together design the implementation process, which had to initiate with the feasibility study. and during that discussion they outlined, every partyâ€™s responsibility in order to implement that feasibility study.",3,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"if i understood very well so abbott took initiative to propose it to the government of rwanda a model of ppp, yes?","abbott proposed services, then the government had to abide by the laws. the government of rwanda has a ppp law in place that would govern that partnership. so, it's not abbott that introduced a different mechanism of partnering with the government of rwanda, rather they propose their services and they were to be governed by the ppp law, which is in place in rwanda.",4,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
for the abbott to propose the service to the government of rwanda how did they know what was in the need? on which basis abbott advanced its idea to propose the services?,"abbott like any other pharmaceutical company or public health company does its market research and it works in so many countries, all over the world. so, some of the services that will need platforms utilization includes hiv and some other testing services. so, abbott new that in rwanda, there is definitely a need. so, all they wanted was to turn that need into a demand because apple didn't have such machines before. so, they wanted to get into that new market and they wanted to get in differently because in some other, so many other countries, abbott has not done it in a ppp model ppp, they do it in a supply and a customer relationship, not a ppp as such. so, it was a new thing. they wanted to start with rwanda, which is actually a new market. and that's how they come up with that idea. and they were allowed to conduct their baseline assessments so that they can, come up with a proposal based on the facts, based on the data that are in place.",5,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"thank you very much for this. and we are really interested to know about this experience of abbott, because we can base on it maybe for the future development. ","i was saying that the random law is very clear about the ppp when there is a solicitation from the government to a private partner for some services for partnership, then they don't go through this feasibility or proof of concepts. so given that we've gone through the feasibility study, it's a sign that it's the supplier or the private company that approached fast, the government of rwanda. so, that is an official information that is available. it doesn't mean, probably they didn't talk to some officials, probably they talked, but they were not solicited by the government. ",6,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"this is very good, so how abbott come in to negotiate with rwanda to contract with the government? how the negotiations went on? ","yeah thank you very much if i understood properly, i think negotiation means discussing the terms, how do you render the services and, at what cost, and thenactually if i take the two parameters, the cost and the services for the package abbotttry to bring in, i meaninnovations that would solve many challenges that are faced in rwanda, like for the supply chain, for example, abbottbrought in solutions that would solve the issues of expiries and stock outs and, under stocks in laboratories. ",7,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"what was the sticking point around these negotiations, was it accepted as proposed? ","yeah, like from the side of the government of rwanda, you can see that one of not accepting a higher price, this is the point they could not give up on, maybe that one is the one i can mention. the government didn't want to spend more than it used to spend on similar services, even though they were interested of course, with the additional services, but they didn't want to spend more. ",8,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
how did you solve to include the additional services and maintain the price? ,"yeah, there is a lot that is done in terms of price setting. of course, you look at so many parameters and you may cut operational costs where you can, but abbott was not losing while reducing the price because there are some other strategies of keeping the costs because the price it has so many dimensions. there are some other areas where we can, cut like operational costs or anything. so, by accepting that price, abbott found a way of not losing or keeping the business viable, ",9,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
did the services continue to be offered as proposed initially or changed according to the price?,"no, there's nothing that was changed actually, because the price reduced.",10,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"yeah. thank you very much. so, who was involved in this initial design of the ppp negotiation? ","of course, there are two parties, abbott and the government of rwanda. in the government of rwanda, there are so many governmental institutions, especially the sector ministry, the ministry of health, and ministry of finance as this is somehow related to finance and economic development. and then rdb that is in charge of businesses and, ppp as well. there is also, i think rpp is under the ministry of finance and economic planning. so, there are hospitals managers were also represented because those instruments are to be installed in hospitals that is on the side of the government. they formed a forum composed of representatives from all those institutions that was called a steering committee and that is per the ppp law, in addition to the two parties abbott and the government. there was another partner to the government of rwanda, which is chai which was a kind of supporting the government of rwanda, providing technical assistance and logistical assistance for all the activities related to implementing the ppp, starting with the feasibility study to take place smoothly. so, the three chai, government of rwanda and abbott are the parties that were in place to make sure that the ppp takes place. ",11,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
that's very good does rssb were involved? ,"no, rssb was not involved.",12,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"as you are familiar with the health system in rwanda, so which hospitals were involved how health sectors represented?","yeah, actually at the start 13 hospitals were selected and, there are at all the levels that are referral hospitals that are provincial hospitals and district hospitals. so actually, it was like a geographical representation, not only at the certain level of the hospitals but at different areas of the country, north, west, south and east with kigali city all are represented. ",13,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
who was leading the negotiation on the side of government of rwanda?,"there is a steering committee, there is a steering committee which was chaired by one of the government officials then, it was reporting, of course to the ministry. actually, it was not a one ministry activity it was involving both, i mean the three big institutions, ministry of finance, ministry of health and rdb, so they had put in place a committee to oversee all the activities, which are this steering committee. it was chaired by an official from rbc.",14,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"if i understood you well, in technical assistant of chai they conducted the feasibility study, and abbott also conducted feasibility study, so were the two separate feasibility studies or one combined. so, can you expand a little bit more on this? ","what abbott conducted was to actually try to have data to base on so that they can come up with a proposal, that one, they did it separately. it was not a joint activity. it's just for them to have access to information, to know how many tests do you have, how much time does it take for the reagents to be delivered so that they may come up with solution to problems they understand better that one is like a baseline for them to be able to provide an offer. but later on, after the engagement was signed between the ministry and an abbott, then the feasibility study for it to be evaluated, chai came in and facilitated the coordination and the evaluation. of course, the evaluation was joined between the minister of health and abbott and chai and rbc, of course, to make sure they collect data about the impact that is being brought by, the new ppp. ",15,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
so how did the actors involved in this design process changed between the initial design and the final agreement so how it went on? ,"yeah, thank you very much there is a question you raised earlier knowing if rssb was involved as part of these discussions. rssb was not and actually, if you look at the way services are rendered in hospitals, they tie what they deliver to the minimum package that is an official or guiding a list of services and prices they need to base on. so, in some level, like in provincial, i think, and district hospitals, there are some of the services that were to be done using the abbott technologies, but they were not part of the minimum package of that level. so that means there is no way you can prove the efficiency when service is not being done. like that one is one of the challenges that made the feasibility study not really a success because, if you have a specialist in a district hospital that specialist cannot request a certain lab test, certain exam, because it's not going to be paid by the insurance, the public insurance organization. so that is the major challenge that was faced. and actually, there are recent discussions where those machines can be moved from where they are while the issue of the minimum package and the tariff in the public hospitals is not yet revised and make it official to include those tests that were not there before.",16,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
did you bring these challenges on the table of negotiation?,"yeah, they were brought on the table. they were discussed with the ministry, but it's not something you solve immediately it's it takes some time because it doesn't depend on one institution it takes to involve the social security the rssb, which manages the insurance. and the solution was not to come in a day or two. that's why one of the options were done were to move the machines to sites that we learn that allowed to carry out those tests. for example, in referral hospitals, we didn't face any problem of that kind, but in district and i think provincial as well, because provincials don't have the full package of services. so that is the major challenge that made with us reverse or look for an alternative way. ",17,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
so how did the actors involved in the design process change between the initial design and the final agreement?,"actually, it's as if this question assumes the final agreement was reached, but it's not yet ",18,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"so, it is still under negotiation?","yes. there are agreements on what is being done and the price and the services that are being rendered by abbott that is a form of agreement, but it's not a definitive public private partnership. ",19,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"but the actors who were in the negotiation team are still the same, or they have been changed? ","yeah, because it took longer it took very long, longer than planned because of those challenges.some people have been moving, of course there is a turnover in every institution, but in terms of institutions and representation, there is no institution that was withdrawn or removed from this process. only individuals have been moving, and this is something that happens continuously in any organization. so, teams have changed and so many people have moved away from where they used to be like, the chair of the steering committee is no longer there. so, there are so many changes that took place. ",20,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
how did this change affected the process and the progress?,"yeah, but also many other big kinds of strong factor came in place which i think may lead us believe that they are the only factors because those are the factors. we couldn't observe the effect since they're not the only ones they're not alone for example, because of covid some of the activities were stopped. so, people tend to believe that everything that happened or that did not happen was due to covid probably the absence of some people would impact, but we can't account about it since covid, if everyone was there, covid, wouldn't allow that we progress. so, the big animal we see is covid than seeing people moving and affecting the progress of the activities. ",21,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
so how covid-19 affected the process? ,"yes, especially the evaluation, the evaluation of the feasibility study. ",22,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"so, in this interval have there been any champions supporting the ppp?","so, we got separate individuals to institutions. of course, there are champions, there are people who were presenting their respective institutions in this process. and they're the ones who champion this ppp. ",23,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
have there been any actor trying to propose opposite direction from the main actors working in the ppp? ,"no, there was not any actors proposing to reverse or change anything, ",24,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"so, who or which institution have been ultimately responsible for approving the ppp design? ","actually, it's not a one institution responsibility. it was done jointly between different sectors as well, because if we had a rdb and a minister of finance, and there is no single institution that would decide on its own it's a joint activity. of course, there are phases that are there for approving the process but it doesn't depend on one institution. they aligned ministry, the sector ministry, which is ministry of health was managing it on day-to-day basis. but they could not resolve everything before consulting or submitting to the steering committee or having the review by rdb and ministry of finance. because as per ppp law, it's like a in the procurement process, there is no single position or person who can decide all the steps. it goes through different hands. so that it can ensure review and transparency. so that's why we cannot say there is only one that will be like the main major one or the one who would influence separately. ",25,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"so, what option were or still being considered when designing the ppp model?","thank you very much, if i may explain the way i understand it first of all abbott proposed the placement of instruments in different hospitals. so, placement in what we call reagent agreement plan whereby the machine is not purchased by the customer but placed by the manufacturer or the supplier and the business will turn around the purchase of reagents. and actually, the maintenance is guaranteed by the supplier. so that's what is still going on abbott placed instruments and for those instruments whereby the tests done those point of care, if i may say so, like chemistry, hematology, there is no referral. the machine does perform the test for that facility where it is installed, because those are tests that are required in emergency or immediately the decision needs to be made for the patient.",26,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"thank you very much. does abbott selected the health facilities, which it would want to operate in, or the health facilities were assigned by the government?","that one, i cannot give an exact answer but it was agreed upon between the two parties. i don't know who brought the list first, or if abbot wished to go in, a, b, c, d, but i'm not sure they would come with a choice, but it may have been, guided by the ministry, and then they came up with an agreement to operate in the 13 facilities.",27,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
which criteria were based on to select the hospitals you are working in?,"yes, the major criteria was let's say geographical because the hospitals that were selected, most of them are satellite labs in across near the borders. so, you can see all the corners of the country were represented. another factor, which, i'm not certain about may be the volume for the two parties to find an adequate sample to prove the concept they needed, adequate, amount of testimonial so that they can, demonstrate if the efficiency or the viability of that business.",28,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
how appropriate do you find the design of this model of abbott to the local context?,"it doesn't match exactly the situation in country, but it can be adapted. for example, the bottoms that were observed, there are things that can be worked on and things can move very well for the example i gave is about the prices in the facilities, if the prices or the tariff depends on the minimum package, i think the government can work on that and, come up with a solution because, what we call minimum is not actually the, the limit minimum is the, at least what, you're supposed to do. it's not the maximum you need to provide a service. so, if that interpretation is converted into a decision to allow the facilities, to submit the bills with those extra services, it's an easy thing to adapt. so, the model is fine with rwanda, but the, the small bottoms can be addressed.i'm not sure there is a perfect model that can come without any need for adapting or adjusting. yeah, but it doesn't mean it's not adapted to rwanda.",29,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"can you insist on that, elaborate a little bit more on that?","yeah, actually the ppp which is between one supplier and the government. it's not pleasant to other suppliers who are also interested in the market. that is one factor on business side. ",30,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"so, thank you so much. what you would recommend as the process to have a buy-in for all stakeholders?","example, i'm not the one to decide or propose, but i think, if abbott won the contract in the government of rwanda, the way it is stated that they will be the ones to supply and actually to manage the labs. that's how the statement of the cabinet resolution says so that would mean if they there were to be exclusive, some other suppliers may not, be in the market anymore. so, if they can still sustain all the services well, and good, the population is going to be served, but the side of being disruptive is on that the competition, so that's it and that is a perception of course, that many other suppliers may have. and i, i think that's all i can say, but in case of not wanting to rely on only one supplier, maybe the government can decide to combine all to make sure they have strong commitment with that supplier so that they prevent any potential of the interruption of the services",31,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
what would you recommend because you know in rwanda because you are familiar with the local context?,"yeah, thank you very much, actually i think for you to be able to win the buying in of those stakeholders you need to make sure you provide the proposal or a model that really meets what they care about. if for example, their biggest concern is about accessibility quality of the diagnostic services. then that's what you need to bring on the table, as a solution that would solve the most pricing challenges they're facing. if in another market, their problem is about efficiency or financial accessibility. then you need to adapt the model to the problems its context is facing.",32,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
what would be an ideal ppp design accommodate the needs of priority population?,"yeah, in rwanda, for example in terms of geographical accessibility, and in terms of the population size, we don't need to multiply giant equipmentâ€™s in all the facilities we rather need to create and strengthen the hubs. you see, for example, if you have a population in kigali, that's not, beyond two, 2.5 million, we don't need to have five to seven big laboratories with big equipmentâ€™s. you can have like two or three few sites that do the specialized testing you see, and then for the remote facilities, maybe you can place, like 10 points of care, to make sure at least the screening is done there. and the referral is done for only those that need confirmation. but in rwanda, we don't need to multiply big platform, diagnostic platforms in all the facilities, except those that need immediate results by the clinicians.",33,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"current design you are working with in abbott, is different from this ideal design you are talking about if you compare?","yeah actually, i think to make sure all the levels, all the groups of the population are served. the ppp model would take into account a holistic healthcare delivery. holistic means from the community level to referral and acute and sophisticated care. so that means deploying adequate or appropriate resources, depending on the level. and the needs of the population. of course, some of those services will be a bit centralized and found to the specialized facility with facilities, with equipment and staff that is able to utilize that. but for example, in the community they need let's say for maternal and child health the primary healthcare that is delivered to those two groups, it doesn't require sophisticated equipment, but it needs to be accessible and near everyone in the community level, for example, at the health post level.",34,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"so, what would be necessary to get to the ppp closer to the ideal vision? so compared to your ideal model and what is being done, so what will be required to get closer to that?","yeah. if i compare actually the proposal that abbott submitted to the government of rwanda, it didn't consolidate all the solutions that abbott have, for example in the later on, after the ppp actually had initiated abbot also brought in a support to the construction of community. i mean those community facilities are called health post. the health post and equipped with small kits a bundle of tests that are needed, the most in the community. for example, if those were incorporated in the, in the package that was submitted in the ppp the value and the impact it would have to the community in general would be greater than only deploying large, sophisticated equipment. so of course, they introduced that, but it's not part of the ppp that is being the discussed.",35,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
thank you very much. so how has gender or social economic status or poor influenced the design of the ppp?,"yeah, actually for abbott because is a big institution that has so many divisions. that's whywhen we talk of rapid diagnostic, it's a separate division. when we talk of molecular, it's a separate division and the others diagnostic, but if there was an integration, when they had to propose something to a country, they do an integration of all those components to make comprehensive and holistic package that covers all the needs. of course, if there is a gap that can be, cannot be covered by one supplier it would be a good, to be wiser for the government to look for supplementary partnership. it doesn't mean partnering with the government is you need to be only one supplier, if is better in rapid and point of care than in molecular, for example the government can contract for a particular package and then look for another one for another particular package. but if you look for one supplier that can serve you everything, i'm not sure i will get the best for everything. yeah, letâ€™s say for you to put on a complete you to wear your clothes, you don't buy from the same house. you don't put on the same brand. some brands of shoes are better in one house. and for the suit, you look for another one.but it's not compulsory that you can contract to one supplier for everything. all you need to is to map your needs from start from the tank to head and make sure on every stage you contract the test in that area.",36,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
so how would the ppp design address key consideration to improve access of laboratory diagnostics if ppp is proposed?,"apart from the urban population, the population of rwanda is somehow homogenous to the point that you cannot say that in the eastern part of rwanda, probably they are poor, or they have particular diseases that will need different prescription of instrument and service. so, the technologies and the services that were deployed to every participating site did not take into account such differences because it's assumed they're not major. so, i think gender and social economy they didn't influence much, maybe it's because of the type of test that were part of the feasibility. i mean the ppp if you were to talk about maternal child health, as i was talking about it earlier, probably that will be taken into account social economic. let's say, if we are talking about malaria diagnosis, maybe some geographical, social or economic status of populations may influence the type of resources to allocate to.may be the type of diseases that are covered with the equipmentâ€™s in this ppp, don't make a significant difference in terms of populations in different areas.",37,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"what about the availability or the quality, efficiency and affordability of laboratory diagnostics in the ppp?","i think apart from the fact that some were not allowed to wouldn't be reimbursed for the test they did for, ensure customers otherwise labs would benefit from this ppp equally, because there is no particular challenge in regards to utilizing the instruments following the model that was adopted.",38,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
thank you very much. so which consideration is the best served by the current design? if you compare what you have said and what is being offered by abbott? ,"yeah, laboratory diagnostic, actually the cost or the price is not only dependent on what is supplied, what is purchased from the supplier's itâ€™s multifactorial parameter. it depends on the operational cost. it depends on the other inputs, other resources that are put in place at the facility level across all the chain, actually. so, in terms of efficiency, i think we haven't reached a level where we start, really seeing, a big impact because, when you utilize a few tests, you don't see a significant impact on the cost, but if the volume increases, then you can benefit much more from the efficiency. yeah. maybe we haven't reached that level mathematically we can demonstrate it, but operationally we didn't reach that level because the test volumes were very low.",39,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"thank you. i was asking about among these consideration you are talking about, so which is currently receiving the least attention in the current design and the why?","for example, in terms of harmonization, which has always been a challenges abbott was proposing instruments.so, letâ€™s say for hematology, it's one type for chemistry, itâ€™s one type that means you'll get rid of those multiple brands and multiple brands actually means multiple types of reagents, multiple contracts, multiple everything. so, harmonization is catered for, and actually since we were inspired about the challenge is being faced in terms of delivery of reagents on time, so abbott is also solving the issue of delivering the reagents by cutting the chain, shortening the chain because when the supply chain is very long, it increases the cost operational costs. and it reaches the facility when it is really expensive. and it also increases the time, the delivery time, but abbott came up with approach of delivering directly to the hospitals. so, the supply side, the harmonization and actually the it solutions that were installed on the machines, which help visualize the data remotely. it's also a solution that helps, the managers to oversee what is taking place in the facilities.",40,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"thank you very much. so, what factors do you think changed the discussion around the ppp?","i can't say there is something not being given the attention because every party hasn't come up with this negotiation points and where they stand in terms of every aspect, but informally you hear people fearing monopoly, let me explain it by the situation whereby rely on one supplier because people maybe tend to believe that when you are only with one supplier in case anything went wrong, you'll be putting your population at risk. so that is one side people tend to believe it's, a challenge but if well discussed it cannot be a challenge. yeah, that's one of the things.",41,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
can you elaborate little bit more about how covid 19 affected the ppp design?,"it's hard to tell actually the factors, but let me say that ppp is not new, but in health sector, that kind of ppp was something new. so, for anything new, there are always some unpredicted events or maybe people don't immediately believe what is being said. so, believing a new, strategy of doing business while you are used to operating with multiple suppliers, probably might affect the way people perceive the ppp it's a new thing. and people tend to fear to be reluctant getting into it as maybe they never know, they're not sure about what is going to result from it.",42,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"oh, thank you very much. so, if there is any technical support facilitating and financing for the ppp, how would the availability of this support affect the ppp design?","the way it affected the way covid affected is that there was an evaluation going evaluation of the feasibility study, the outcome of that pilot phase. so that one did not continue because all the attention was paid to covid response, but it's not that people are not testing. people are testing, but the meetings we would hold to discuss the outcomes, the site visits that were being, conducted all those activities were delayed. that's how covid affected.",43,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"that is very important. so, what are the features of the ppp design that would not be possible without this technical support?","i think when things are well done in the start at the planning phase then the implementation and the results will be a success. so, prescribing a model should rely on a well and thoroughly analyzed context and content of the ppp. so, to me if the technical support and financial support is provided to understand the context, to understand the model to put in place all the terms of the agreement to be well started, to make sure it's viable cooperation between the two parties. that's where the intervention is much needed. and it will benefit quick implementation because part of the analysis it can do is understanding the content. for example, there is a challenge related to the test that will not be done because they're not on the tariff, if that was for seen, maybe a timely decision would have made, we would have been made and the challenges that resulted from that one wouldn't be faced. so, i think the support is needed heavily at the start at the conception phase to make sure the rest of the phases are running smoothly without any challenge.",44,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"how would you recommend that technical support being used to address any gap, existing gap, all weaknesses capacity among key stakeholders?","first of all, what is done the, engagement, the implementation, the placement of the instruments or any solutions is a result of both parties being convinced that this thing is doable and is profitable. so, the fact that the proposal, the initial also makes sense to every party is the only convincing step to the following stages of the theme. so, if the planning or the proposal phase is not well established it's very likely that the ppp, all the phases be it, the engagement or the implementation are not, is not going to be done successfully.",45,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"so, the following questions is about, the policy context and the historical relationship that influence over the ppp. so, the question is how supportive is the existing policy legal and the regulatory framework for ppp?","i think if, this support was addressed to the government, because the suppliers will respond to the partnership and actually, they'll come in filling the cops or providing services that were requested by the government. so, it's better that the government be able to understand the needs because the government has the vision knows where they want to take a population, too but the quality of the services they want to achieve in 50 years, but it's not the supplier to come and tell you that i have a solution to all your problems. sometimes he can mislead you. oh, he can give you what you don't really need. maybe you need it today, but in a few years, it won't be to serving your population the way you want. so, if that support was allocated to governments to clearly, do an analysis for an assessment of the needs, do a projection of what kind of services they need, now and in the future, and then come up with requirements for a service provider to come in.",46,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
so how much resistance among policy makers will these ppp need to overcome to garner the necessary support?,"yeah, in the case of rwanda, since rwanda has already, ppp law in place and the organs that in enforce that policy and that law actually are in place and active, it's not only in papers, but it's something that is in practice. that means when the proposal came, there was a clear interpretation and orientation as to what, procedures need to be followed, as per the law. so, the presence of a law in place is something, that, and the law was really clear. it's not related something related or it's clearly stated, uh, public private partnership. so, the presence of that law, which indicates all the processes, all the procedures to follow all those committees to be formed the process step by step from the proposal to the sign off of the agreement, definitive agreement, it really guided, there was no confusion at all.",47,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
how flexible is the ppp to changes in the government or government priorities?,"you see, actually anything that is new, these approaches are new and they're being introduced for the first time. so of course, people who in a certain comfort of having multiple suppliers, having multiple options may be reluctant to opting a few one or for a certain service. so, resistance cannot be overlooked but it can be overcome, in such a way that any potential show reasons for resistance or any unanswered questions can be answered upfront while am establishing the project proposal of the ppp cause that proposal should be able to answer any potential questions that can be raised from many actors from all the people who would need to buy that idea when it details all the processes from start to the end. well, clearly defined everyone would find answers to the questions it would be raising.",48,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
how flexible the ppp should be in the case of these priorities change?,"i think it depends on how it started, but in my view, ppp should come based on the needs of the government. for example, if a government needs to offer certain services to the population while the government itself doesn't have the means or the resources to operate it to, solely then it needs to partner with some private organizations. so, in that case at least even if you don't have all the means to provide those services, alone, at least you know, the minimum requirement is defining your problems clearly and what the solutions to your problems should look like when you know the solutions, what you are looking for, it's easy to attract anyone, you know, that they're not going to stretch you. and they have you from you're looking for you are farm through what you want offer to your population and what means you have in place yeah, i think that's where, emphasis need to be put",49,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"yeah. so, if tomorrow we need to establish a ppp another kind of ppp so what kind of experience or lessons that you may suggest to pay attention with to have the success?","it's just to be provided by the agreement. for example, if you agreed that you are going to do a certain project together with an organization, and then later on you find different other facts that and redirect the intervention for the implementation, then it has to be stipulated in the agreements. of course, the agreement shouldn't be written on stone, there should be ways of amending the agreements as you go along with the implementation. so, if that is stated in the agreement that there will be, let's say the monitoring mechanism of seeing how things evolve and adapting to the context and to the situation. that's the only way you can have the ppp flexible. the ppp it's not something that is already meant. it's an agreement you are going to make depending on what you envisioned to do together. so, it's up to the two parties to agree.",50,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
what are the similarities or differences between the approach of ahdp and abbott or roche?,"thank you very much, actually the first thing is engaging all the stakeholders. if you exclude any later on, you would see that you would have consulted that had the stakeholder. for example, if in the health sector, we need finance, we need healthcare insurance. we need the hospitals for us to make, informed the decision. we need to involve them at the start and let them understand what we envisage to do in details. yeah, that part is really crucial and, it can help implementation with many more resistance.",51,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
how trusting collaborative is the relationship between the public private sectors for health?,"well, i think ahdp is like a mechanism of facilitating countries acquire those agreements. it's not like abbott or roche. if i read properly, it's like an initiative that is going to help developing countries to acquire or to enter this agreement. in terms of roche and abbott they're similar in terms their nature. they are both public health organizations and actually their scope of operation is in terms of product lines. the only difference depended heavily on the performance. otherwise, the equipment, the technologies, they have so many similarities, one is stronger in this aspect. another one is stronger in the other aspect. my previous version may be not as good as yours, but tomorrow i can up with a better version. so, they keep, um, competing and everyone has something, he presents as an advantage.",52,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
how has historical relationship between the public and the private sector for health influenced the current ppp arrangement?,"i think apart from even the health sector, in rwanda the government and the service providers or private operators, i think there is a lot of trust. the trust, the level of trust is really high. and actually, the reason, the fact behind that is that for example, you supply good or services to the government, you're quite sure i'll be paid it's really something, very precious in rwanda that there is no supplier who can supply you or request you to pay upfront because it doesn't trust, you'll pay later on. so that is something really that increases the trust, the level of trust between the governmental or private organizations. second, maybe the government also has some trust to private, organizations in such a way that to ensure or to assert that trust is maintained high.",53,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"thank you very much. so, what has been the historic investment and interest from government in laboratory diagnostic? ","for example, in my experience with the procurement entity in rwanda, i worked with both the central medical supply that is rms and which are all doing, procurement apart from a few suppliers who used to request for advanced payment because of some other factors, not the lack of trust, almost all the suppliers are happy to sign the contract and send the suppliers and wait for being paid later on. secondly now that most public institutions are e-procurement, there is really demonstrated transparency. it's much clearer than, it was before. so based on that, i can attest that, the level of trust and, based on my experience with, all those suppliers who send their products and feel comfortable. it is really profound. ",54,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
so how does the improvement in the laboratory diagnostics align with the government priorities for the health sector?,"yeah. first of all, there is infrastructure laboratory have been really upgraded in the past. it used to be a very small room in the corner, where even if you had an equipment, you wouldn't have a place where to install it. so now in almost all the hospitals, the labs were upgraded to a certain really higher standard level in terms of infrastructure of course, the government did that in collaboration with partners, but overall coordination or prioritization is done by the government then in terms capacity building, it's also an investment. the government has trained so many lab scientists, which really increased the diagnostic capacity in laboratories, in terms of equipment. so many equipmentâ€™s were procured, others were placed by leasing.",55,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
what is the profile of health workers relative to diagnostic system including training and cadres?,"actually, if we are aiming at universal healthcare, you can't talk about healthcare without diagnosis and actually for any medical decision laboratory is relied on to provide the results and then guide the clinical decisions. so, with the government's aim of ensuring quality healthcare for all laboratory has played really those investments terms of acquiring equipment, training people expanding the laboratory buildings or building new ones. all those have helped the laboratories to meet that increasing demand in testing. cause when you increase access, that means you increase the number of tests and when you increase the number of tests while the rooms and the testers are not increasing, then there is no way you can meet that target. so, the fact that the labs have increased in terms of infrastructure, the equipment and the personnel is helping meeting that target of ensuring universal health care for all.",56,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"so, who are the key stakeholders in the public private partnership and why are they involved?","i've had opportunities of visiting remote health centers. i think of recent; i think not more than three years i was in health centers and i could notice that there are some, laboratorians who are not really, trained laboratorians. there are people who did some other studies, but because they needed some people in place, they had to train someone who didn't do lab in secondary and then, make him a lab technician to see in terms of human resource. it's still scars, still discuss maybe at hospital level. they have at leastprofessionals who are trained, even if hospitals claim to havelimited budget to hire more given the volume of the work but at least at level of hospitals and up and urban areas, there is adequate staffing, butremote health centers are still suffering maybe because those professionals that did university studies cannot go that far or given the budget to pay them in those remote areas, the conditions of life and the standard they want to be at probably, it's affecting those remote health facilities. but generally, in terms of human resource for laboratory services the level is really considerably good.",57,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
what would be the important of global partnership or funders?,"starting from for health sector, the ministry of health is supposed to be the line ministry which sets policies and see the implementation while rbc is the implementation arm of the government in terms of health. so, their presence is really relevant and is compulsory in terms of ppp. so, looking at the ministry of finance, it comes to partnerships that involves budget. it's a generation of revenue it's generation some income on the side of the government it entails expenditures and expenditures are done by the ministry of finance. so apart from their role in planning, they also have a say in terms of expenses and revenues. so, the ministry of finance really is relevant, stakeholder in terms of the ppp for sector and actually rppa, i don't know if it was mentioned because it's an acquisition means, procurement or purchasing something, so r ppa is the regulatory body for the procurement processes for government organizations, rwanda development board, is the one that is in charge of all business development.be it purely private, they're the ones who provide an environment who register the businesses, be it a partnership with the government they're also involved because they kind of regulate the business development, in terms ofprivate and public partnership.rwanda medical supply, if they have the responsibility now to procure commodities, if the procurement is going to be done in a different other mechanism, they need to be involved. they are resourceful in terms of knowing the workflow, the flow of commodities, the challenges, the realities in the field, or if they need to be part of the channel, of that partnership they need also to be involved in the ppp. they may not later on participate in the implementation, but they need to be part of the bigger forum to make sure they provide their input because they're experts in terms of supplies of medical products. and they're the ones who feel the challenges, the needs of the customer in terms of supply.",58,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"so, thank you for considering this list of stakeholders so how do they perceive the advantages and the disadvantages of the ppp?","yeah, the funders operate in many countries. they have access to data or access to foreign experiences. that is one thing. second, they have a stake as they're also funding. if youvalue my funding, you'll involve me in all the decisions that are going to be funded with my money. so, they're like, uh, the partners, the development partners of the government, you can there's no way you can leave them aside while starting something which you will again, call them to help you in finance. so, in addition to the experience, the whole budget that you'll need in the future, so you need their expertise in many other countries to see that concept was done elsewhere and was successful.",59,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
what would be their incentives to participate in ppp?,"yeah. i think the perspective vary depending on institution, for example, you are out of the sector, your judgment or your perception is going to be totally different if the cost benefits or the ministry of health and rbc, are there to oversee all those technical aspects or the clinical of benefits. so, i think on the budget side, they look at the profitability, those who are in the health sector they will look at, especially doesn't mean they don't look at the other side, but, they're more focused or more concerned with the clinical outcomes the technical benefits of that partnership. so, it depends on really the institution and the area of expertise for the insurance, companies maybe if you may promote something that increases the cost, but also increases the quality of services as a technical or clinical organization. but for the insurance, they will see it as an extra expense. they'll perceive it differently. so, the perception defers depending on where you seat.",60,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
how interested are the private partners in participating in ppp?,"some of them, i think most of them actually by the law, they have to participate because they have the role to play. it's part of their work. if anything comes up related to ppp it says you'll be involved if you are rdb, the ministry of finance or if you are the line ministry of that sector. so, but the other motivation in addition to being a mandate of your institution is solving a problem that was not to be solved with the government means. so that one would attract you because you found a partner who is going to fund or to provide his inputs or investments. so that is a particular problem that we couldn't afford to with our means is going to be solved. so that a motivation that is behind any organization to get involved in ppp is actually problem solving.",61,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"so, what are private partnerâ€™s main questions around participating in the ppp? ","let's say, if a test is done in a private lab or if it is done in public i think, provided that the quality of service rendered to the customer, the patient is really maintained. otherwise, there is no rules, even if the labs were private and i don't think the government is at the point of competing with the private sector provided that the patient can peace out. so, i think there is no loss, maybe when it is done in the public, the private labs, maybe losing business, but if it is done in private, since the government is not competing very much with the private businesses, i think, the major thing is that the customer be served for sure the fact that tests are done in public probably the private labs may be not benefit because they set up the businesses for them to make money. so, if test is done away that means there is an opportunity you're not getting. ",62,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
what are the biggest incentives for private partners to participate in the ppp in country?,"i think this ppp concept is not yet clear to everyone. that means even the managers of these, these big farms, don't perceive it as a way to go generally, but probably with time, if they were approached probably and discussed and maybe they can get much more interested, but a traditional way of doing this business in, biotech sector is making sure you place your instrument and they purchase your reagents. that is the core business, the core mission. so, the ppp, i don't think many companies have started thinking about it though it is a way that it's a win-win situation you sell and the governments also benefit. so, i'm not sure, i think their interest is not yet high. ",63,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
okay so what are the biggest drawbacks for private partners to participate in the ppp? ,"their major concern is the volume, the testing volume. they need to see the return by having the so many reagents purchased. that is their major concern, it wasn't sufficient for the areas like i said for, because of those tariffs, some of the tests were affected, so the volumes were not high. ",64,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
do you think that private partners working in laboratory diagnostics in rwanda have the capacity to participate and deliver on the ppp. why and why not? ,to gain the biggest proportion of the market share.,65,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
"are you aware of the financial instruments that ahdp is offering? if so, what are they? ","the first thing i think, is not having the reference, where else was it successful? how sure are we? that these things are going to work. and actually, given that this process in rwanda took a bit longer than expected, it was, somehow discouraging because was as written earlier, it was something to be done in six to one year and still done, but it didn't go that fast. so, the projections that were done, you know, these commercial organizations, they do projections of the sales every year. so, if you don't meet that target that, yeah. it's already a loss. so that is the fact that things don't move to the pace that was expected is really, somehow discouraging. ",66,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
do you think that these financial instrument from ahdp sufficient to incentivize the private sector engagement in the ppp? why and why not?,"the answer is yes and no. yes. why? because on their product lines, they produce they can put those machines or those solutions in the agreement, but they don't manufacture everything that means if you are to enter in an agreement for the lab, it's good that the scope be limited to what you can offer. and then the remaining part can be sourced elsewhere. my know part of the response is based on that actually, there is no one that can manufacture everything or even if you can manufacture everything, it doesn't mean you are the best in everything. ",67,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
are private partners interested in taking up the available financial instrument offered by ahdp? why and why not? ,"there is a rough estimate i saw onthe page i read the budget 1.25 million dollars, but i think itâ€™s a work-sum that may be divided into different, costs probably not dedicated fully to equipment. there is also oversight management, everything. i don't think it's directly to purchase equipment, but, uh, i think it's divided into portions, but i saw that figure. okay. it is 76 million and 1.25 million dollars, i think. yeah. ",68,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
what are or could be the plans in the place to support public sector financing of diagnostics in the future? ,"i think if i was to give my opinion on that money shouldn't purchase equipment, the money should put in place clarity of what is needed in each country participating and how, what is the best or the optimal model that is suitable for each country. those studies of really defining how the model can be, what type of model is suitable for each country. that's where investment needs to go. otherwise, the private, these private organizations, even elsewhere, even in europe, they don't sell them. they have a price, of course, but very few customers can buy them, you place your instrument but shouldn't be allocated to buying equipmentâ€™s, probably conducting studies of providing evidences, facilitating sessions of establishing the, the ppp models. yeah. the oversight, and actually informing a right decision to make wrong for some countries, they may need more than that because there are some infrastructure upgrades that you may need and countries, some countries may not have the budget for that infrastructure upgrades somewhere.",69,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_29
is there anything else you would like to discuss about ppp that we have not talked about? ,"it all depends on how you sold the idea. cause for these private companies their interest is selling. the primary objective is selling, of course they're called public health organization. it's saving lives, but their mission, the first indicator that they're doing their job is the sell. so, if in that proposal or in that idea, they're seeing how they're going to make their sells, then why not, it's possible. and given that ahdp it's a strong voice because it's looking for on behalf of so many countries it's nothing, partner to, to discuss with. cause here we are talking about more than five countries. that is a large population. so, it's, so it's actually a kind of pulled procurement, a pulled procurement, like you are taking five countries and you are bringing all their volumes together. you are the suppliers to see if they're interested. i think most of them, they will say i'm coming in. i'm also able i'm also interested in telling you, if, you win a market of five countries, you are yourselves. so, it's really attractive.

","thank you very much, i think in terms of financing, i would say, i will talk about what it could be because, talking about what is in place, why you don't own the those plans. it may be hard. it won't be accurate, but in my opinion, what would be, that kind of public financing we are talking of, sustainability in series of sustainability. so, letâ€™s say, we are partnering with a company that manufactures a certain line of products, but tomorrow or after tomorrow, we need to get to a level where we can make it ourselves.

","with sureness attitude , at this time we have clients, people want the available services, the habit of health seeking behaviors have changed overtime in rwanda , second the tariffs that the insurance companies are offering, that is something thatshould be looked at , and the amount of investment that should be put in place. i am quite sure if someone has to invest, the people who are going to consume services are available as long as it is not straining his/her financial capacity because our community is still poor, so we need to look at the good standards of the services but which are affordable.",6,rwa-int-pe-2021-10-11
how flexible is the ppp or contract modalities to changes in government or government priorities? ,"with the attitude of happiness , i would dwell much on existing atmosphere, not exactly policy but policies are in place including the ppp policy that the government of rwanda have established. in rdb they follow up on that on big investments, long term investments, and the whole process around it. but also i have seen partnership with ministry of health, an example of abbott diagnostics the way they manage some laboratories that atmosphere, i think it is favorable for any other further discussion and for any further ppp investment.",7,rwa-int-pe-2021-10-11

what has been the historic investment and interest from government in laboratory diagnostics? ,"with the attitude of happiness , that is a very good thinking direction because decentralization in rwanda, local government, community are the very key important to think about, because without focusing on those you canâ€™t talk about ppp. the community has to be involved and give their views on what they desire to have andbe able to commit if they are able to pay or to consume the services.",12,rwa-int-pe-2021-10-11
who are key stakeholders that should be involved in developing the ppp or contracting modalities and why?,"with sureness attitude , i think the government has been interested in improving and standardizing laboratory services, if you look at national laboratory how it performs, and how the referral laboratories are being monitored and supported, the evaluations of slmta strengthening laboratory management toward accreditationand others that are putting laboratories in accreditations. but still for a laboratory to function well they require a huge investmentif you look at any referral hospitals with specialized doctors, these hospitals need a standardized laboratory with well-trained laboratory technicians, equipment and consumables . this may strain the government to have enough money to invest in laboratories .the community is supposed to be able to pay for those services so that they can be sustainable.",13,rwa-int-pe-2021-10-11
what is the relative influence of these actors on negotiations of this nature? ,"this is a broad question it starts at the global level who should involve in giving guidelines to the government, at the national level the moh should put in place favorable conditions and policies that help the investors and also help the public to assist the serviceshealth insurance and setting up tariffs that are conducive to both public and private , at sub national level we have district the local government to understand and be involved to mobilize the community services at the community level. the community have to be able to understand the needs and be able to pay, just to adjust the premium of the insurances.

what are the plans in place to support public sector financing of diagnostics in the future? ,"i think there should be negotiations between the health sector and private investment, and also rdb that oversees the investment in rwanda and come up with a model. recently i think there is no clear model on this partnership and look at all the components that are important in this business model, including the health insurances, the ability to pay and the amount of investment that should be done on each level, this needs a lot of discussions before investing so that we cannot be disappointed if we donâ€™t put all those components into considerations and see how they are going to impact on the business model.",21,rwa-int-pe-2021-10-11
which different sources of funding are expected to be used for financing diagnostics? ,"i think at the policy level, the desire, the political will, the policies are in place though they need to be deeply worked on and i think the market is there, after having, the discussions i mentioned earlier and see which is the standard that can benefit on all of us, if we come up with the idea of how that would look like then we can invest.",22,rwa-int-pe-2021-10-11
is there anything else you would like to discuss about the ppp or contract modalities that we have not talked about? ,"well there is what have been existing, government supports, which empowers our own revenues but also if we have to upgrade there should be some sort of private investment, am not sure if the donors could be willing to invest in ppp but if they are there, they are people that have that interest to support the people that are intending to have ppp that would be very good.",23,rwa-int-pe-2021-10-11
can you please describe your role as it's related to the laboratory diagnostic in rwanda?,"with attitude of convincing , if we want to have a sustainable ppp investment we do not need to rush we have to sit down and discuss, put all the stakeholders on the table and come up with a model which can respond to the needs in rwanda not just picking something from ghana or ethiopia and come and implement it here. we need to look at all parameters",1,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"thank you very much, from your standpoint, what are the key issues that public private partnership or any contracting modalities aiming to improve the laboratory diagnostic services should focus on or include to be successful?","thank you, dr. my role first of all is i am a medical doctor i have a phd in human genetics i'm the director of allied health services in chuk, and in addition i work in laboratory, i do laboratory investigation but in addition to my position, and this department is a clinical biology which is involved in the training overlap, especially related courses which will return to the laboratory in the faculty of medicine.",2,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
can you elaborate more a little bit on what you emphasized more to analyze if the hospitals will lose or benefit? do you have any example that you can now share?,"to be successful, first of all, we have to see clearly, which type of the clause of the contract. for instance, the content of the contract, the type of investigations that will be realized, the type of equipment that will be provided. in addition, in case of the maintenance, the backup equipment; all those are processes of procurements, and even the process of payments, even the reagents delivery details. so, i think that all these need to go in details into the contracts. again the finance also needs to see the aspects of the payments sometimes the cost of the reagents, the equipment, analysis and maintenance are higher than the price that are reimbursed by the community-based insurance and refund, thus the hospital will lose. so, we need to assess these before signing a contract to analyze, will the hospital get any profits? will the hospital lose? these financial aspects should be also considered in details.",3,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"that's very interesting how do you think the need of priority population, such as the poorest household, or these complicated patient cases, cancers or chronic co-morbidities can be accommodated with this kind of ppp?","we have for example a test of biochemistry. if we have urea, and if you look for the cost of the kits from the supplier, and you look at the time the laboratory will spend on doing those investigations, the cost of electricity, the cost of water, the cost of maintenance, and then you realize that the hospital will be losing because the community-based insurance reimbursement will be low compared to the cost of reagents in addition to the expenses of the hospitals ",4,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"if you compare before the ppp comes in, with the current situation, do you think that the cost has increased?","for example, on our side the public facility, may be more than 95%, are people with community-based insurance,the poorest people, it means before negotiating the prices, we can consider that price we have with community-based insurance to make sure that we will be able to provide the services, but also remember we are public institutions, we have some funds that we get from the government, which may cover those hospital losses, and then the hospital can be able to pay the lab technicians and doctors. so, because we have a contribution of the government, we try to adjust the price and then we offer services that can cover those large populations with limited means either through ppp or not",5,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"so, in other words, the effective quality of health services and affordability is more covered with the ppp than before.","i don't think really. because we did the analysis when we had another supplier and we found that it depends on the type of reagents, for example you'll find that one of these reagents is cheaper, the other reagents are quite expensive. nowadays, with the current ppp we have with abbott we have gained because abbott has brought to us the technology, they provided free software, they brought a lot and range of investigations which helped us in analyzing a lot of samples at the same time, we increased the capacity of tesying, but before it was really challenging. let me give you an example of a patient, the doctor has prescribed full blood count, thyroid hormone, full range of chemistry analysis. but when the patient comes to the lab he would find, that we are only able to perform the full blood counts and because the patient doesnâ€™t want to be picked two times, and then decide to go to another hospital where they can be able to perform all those investigations. however, they could be performed in our lab but because of some stock outs of the reagents,then some analysis were stopped and we should spend two months without doing some investigations like creatinine and urea .you can imagine that some operations in the theater were stopped too.",6,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"what do you do with this management and the financing, so the capacity of the different partners to manage, or to deliver the contract, the payment for services, supply chain?","i think yes, because the quality, the affordability and the availability of the services are covered. in case we have the problem of the machine, it's maintained regularly. so we are happy with this partnership.",7,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"thatâ€™s very good. so, what are the cost and the benefit of pursuing a ppp or any contracting modalities in the lab diagnostic?","it was with abbott, with their instructions. and we had the ministerial instructions that allow us to work with the abbott. but when it is time for the payments it follows the usual payments, done by the hospital so it means we have, the finance department which is preparing the purchasing order with the proformat invoice.",8,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"so, what do you recommend? as we are having ppp with abbott at chuk, do you think there can be the scale up of the ppp in the country down there to the health centers? ","based on the ppp that we have with abbott as it is a company which has experience in the laboratory services, until now we are happy with their services, their supply chains, we no longer face the stock outs of reagents. we have new modern equipment, technology and most of them are semi-automated it doesnâ€™t require a lot of efforts to the person using it and the software they brought are interfaced with our management system, open clinics. it facilitates us in laboratory diagnostics regularly.",9,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"so, how supportive is existing the policy and legal and regulatory framework for ppp in rwanda.","it will depend because, i cannot reply saying that what is applicable at chuk can be applicable in health center because we don't have the same volume of patients, we don't have the same packages, because there are some analyses which are allowed to be performed at the referral level, which cannot be performed in the district hospital. for me, in the case of chuk., even though i said that we are happy, but we still have some challenges that we need to improve. but i donâ€™t have experience to other health facilities to say that it can be applied to lower facilities too.",10,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"are you sure that the abbott came with that already signed a contract, without discussion with the hospital?","what i can say do we have a policy for ppp. iâ€™m not aware of that. but maybe because we are doing ppp, we have a policy of legal framework. but one of the challenges we have noticed when this ppp with abbott initiated, during negotiations they did not consider the technical aspect of the laboratory to discuss about what will be done, for our experience with this abbott even we look on the price they were proposing, which were already approved at that time we realized that the hospital will lose, they should have focused in all aspects, technical and clinical aspects, that is how it should normally be when conducting the ppp.",11,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"so, what would you recommend on this aspect about policy, and the legal and regulatory framework?","so maybe my recommendation is to involve all stakeholders, because the ppp we have in the laboratory today, tomorrow can be in other disciplines. clinical discipline or in radiology. we recommend to involve the stakeholders but also to allow some windows of amendment of the contract. i think that there should be a close in case they are not satisfied with the quality of the services to end the contract, without having other legal issues. you know in the health sector this is different from other sectors. all things we do have an impact to the lives of patients so if there is a problem of people who are not satisfied with the service so we need to have a way to cut off or to end the contract.",12,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
do you have this capacity to end this contract with abbott?,"no, at our level i don't think so.",13,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
who signed the contract?,i think that it has been signed by the ministry of health.,14,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
do you know any kind of resistance for ppp at the level of policy makers?,i don't know.,15,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
" and when you saw the abbott coming was well received and now you are satisfied. but, at the introduction of the ppp were you receptive, unhappy, or any kind of resistance?","so, you know, everywhere we have the resistance to change. yeah, there was a lot of resistance.",16,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
but now you are satisfied?,we are quite satisfied with the services.,17,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"so, if you have some information historically, how have the public and the private sector focusing on health interacted in rwanda? ","i think that we have a formal relationship. for example, when the analysis is not available at our hospital, we can tell, informally to the patient, go to bmc, go to lancet go to this one but we don't have any contract with any private laboratory. as you know, an institution does not provide all the laboratory tests. so maybe if we have accredited laboratories, we should have some agreement with them to be able to perform some investigations. and you know that usually private sector has the capacity to introduce new lab investigations, new technology. so maybe we can have partnership with accredited laboratory to help us to perform some investigations because private sector. even we can have some collaboration in quality management, to exchange samples for example for quality control etc.",18,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"so, do you have such framework. ",we don't have such framework. it's informal,19,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"so, how will health system governance arrangements for example decentralization affect the ppp design?","with this experience with abbott, for example the people who signed ppp they didn't take into account that the referral hospital is different from districtâ€™s hospital and health center, and you will find that abbott the machine they brought to chuk is similar to the machine they brought to kibuye hospital and its same machine and yet we don't have the same volumes, the reason why they should have involved all stakeholders on table of discussion. so, when you are signing a ppp you don't have to consider what is applicable only for you and think it can be applicable on other level. for instance, us, we manage because we have a big volume but some district hospital, they don't manage to work with abbott some even have preferred to use the local supplier contract they have, because maybe itâ€™s not even possible with their funds, they don't have even the infrastructure, a large place to install those instruments, they don't have a good internet. so, when signing a ppp, we need to consider all level of the health sectors not to take them as whole package.",20,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"so who should be held accountable for the success of ppp or deliverables, under the selected contract modalities?","so first of all, i think all the people who signed the contract, implementers, the stakeholders, because they attended the meeting and agreed all to make sure the client will be satisfied, i think they will all be able to handle the usersâ€™ complaints. so, i think all people should be held accountable for the success of ppp.",21,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
you told me that the ministry of health is one who signed the contract with abbott. is there any monitoring and evaluation mechanism for follow up?,"i don't know if it is done by moh. but sometimes there are some people who come to collect the data iâ€™m not sure if they are from rbc or from moh. but for us, we are just implementing the contract. i think there is no regular monitoring.",22,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
what do you propose for the efficiency and sustainability of the services?,"maybe as you said to have a monitoring system here, for example, in annual meetings, to see how far the ppp is going on, to have some surveys from the stakeholder, if they are satisfied, but again to the supplier too we should have a meeting with them to see if they are happy to work with us, even to assess the process of payment. so then we may be able to evaluate if we are losing money or if we are gaining money.",23,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"thank you very much. so, what has been the historic investment, and interest from government in the laboratory diagnostics?","there is a huge investment in laboratory, because we have the laboratory services in the hospitals all over the country but still, we need the improvement because laboratory is considered as support services of the hospital and yet it is obvious that the laboratory has not the proper considerations. because it's where we have a few staff and few budgets, itâ€™s a challenge to buy equipment, and there is no adequate training of the staff and even the medical doctor.",24,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
how does improvement in the laboratory diagnostic align with the government priority for the health sector?,with covid19 we have seen that laboratories are key. but for me i think that laboratory services are not prioritized.,25,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"what is the profile of health workers involved in diagnostic system, including training, cadres? ","the challenge we have in our system is that we donâ€™t have medical specialists with laboratory specialties, people always think that laboratory stuff would only be lab technicians, we don't have enough scientists and they are not even on the structure of the hospital so that they can be able to check for the quality and the validity of the test, the reason why we need to invest in the training of health care professionals. , the challenge we had is that we do the laboratory services but we have no one to check for the quality, the validity of the test. so, we need to invest in the training of health care professionals.",26,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"so, who are the key stakeholders that should be involved in developing the ppp?","we need to have the ministry of health, the government policy actors, the stakeholders, the users the hospitals, and maybe even the private sector. and at central, level the governmental officials. ",27,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"so, what is that relative influence over these actors on negotiation of the ppp? ","so, first of all we have the government, which has the high influence, but also, we need to take into consideration other stakeholders, hospitals on the table of discussion, so that they wouldnâ€™t only get the instruction to implement the ppp without knowing how it comes. actually, the users donâ€™t have a lot of influence and yet they should be the ones to decide as they are the ones to implement the ppp.",28,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
whose interests are helped or hurt by laboratory diagnostic happening in the public versus private sector?,"i think it's the patients who would encounter all the consequences as they are the ones to get the lab investigations done. it will be the patient who will benefit, or will be harmed from a good or a bad contract. even the hospital because even the hospital will lose money and will not be able to pay their stuff because they have lost money, but the first person to be impacted by those contracts is the patient.",29,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
what is the biggest incentive for private partners to participate in the ppp?,"so, i think that first of all is a financial benefit but also to see how the contract are managed, because sometimes terms of contract can attract to come in to improve the life.so i think from my view, having a good collaboration with the private sector can attract them to expand their services in our country. we are eager to work with investors.",30,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"do you think that private partners working in the laboratory diagnostic in rwanda, have the capacity to participate and deliver on the ppp.",i don't have any information but i think they are able.,31,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"so, how could ppp be designed to achieve scale-up and sustainability?","i think it should be well structured in a way that before even signing the contract there should situation analysis on the field, the different levels of the health sectors, and even including the community-based insurance in discussion to discuss about the modality of the payment and reinvestment for a ppp to be sustainable. all the items should be taken into consideration at the introduction of the ppp.",32,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
what are the plans in place to support public sector financing of the diagnostic in the future?,"i think the plan that iâ€™m aware of for example is university of rwanda have to develop new curriculum where we will have specialists in the laboratory services and i know the hrh also is planning with the university, to see how the universities can produce those specialists and people with those masters in laboratory sciences.",33,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
which different sources funding are expected to be used for financing diagnostic?,"so, the financing can be provided by the government, the funders, maybe even some research grants, or even the hospital generated funds.",34,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
how has the government increased financing support to the diagnostic during the ppp?,"so, because we have our own budget, we have allocated the budgets to buy the reagents to abbott.",35,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"are these financing plans sustainable?why, and why not.",i think they are.,36,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
how viable are the different sources of funding being considered?,"for us, it is income generated funds and government funds.",37,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"so, is there anything else you would like to discuss about the ppp that we have not talked about?","i think that i have said all the challenge faced during the implementation of the ppp when the end users were not part of the discussion at the beginning, basically when the design of the ppp does not focus and plan well considering all the places.",38,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"so the first question that we have for you is that we want to understand your involvement in the ppp process under the ahdp, the african health diagnostic platform in rwanda. so, and my question will be first to try to understand if you're familiar with the african health diagnostic platform.",thank you. i'm not familiar with african health diagnostics platform. ,39,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
so you have never attended any meeting where this was discussed?,"no, what i attended back in 2020, it was a workshop, organized by chai and the ministry of health. they were exploring the possibilities of using ppp frameworks for laboratory services in rwanda, and they were discussing the pros and cons, looking at the different services and looking at that chain and also service delivery and which part of that chain would be most suitable to fall under ppp and which one wouldnâ€™t.and i remember we requested for the report out of that workshop i think chai was the one handling it, and we never received it. but my particular submission was mostly on the ppp processes that are provided under the regulations that we have and we were very clear that if you decide to take that ppp route, definitely, you must go through the processes that are provided for. and of course, as rdb we usually come in at the point of negotiation.",40,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"i have understood well so you come out quite late in the process, during the negotiations.","during negotiations, though we have had instances in the past on different projects where you know the investor comes in, maybe either to us, or to moh, rbc, and has expressed interest in developing a project but we usually work with them through the process.so, in the feasibility study sometimes we might be sitting as part of the technical team, but by heavily led and supported by the line ministry.and then we gather input between financials, especially because we have some people who work on financials here. they will advise to see the viability of the proposed project, before we move on to approving it by the steering committee and then the contract negotiation.",41,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"but then as you were not actually involved in all the design, especially the design discussions because we were looking at how coming up with a final design, and all the discussions that happened before we come up with a final design and we're interested to get more insight into those discussions.but nevertheless, we still have some few questions for you. the most focused on ppp in rwanda. ","i think, in order for ppp to be successful. i think the prior initial steps are very important actually areas of the feasibility study. i will think it's important that whoever is leading either the line ministry or the proposed investor has adequate data to develop a good feasibility study. and that's going to look mostly on the technical and financial viability of the project or a percept of that ppp. so that, i have found it very important during the ppp process and it really feeds and determines how successful or unsuccessful a ppp will be at the end of the day. the results of the feasibility study definitely also inform what would be put into the contract between the parties. it would really also give you a good understanding of what the project implementation will look like. because parties will have enough data and understanding what the findings are. you know what the loopholes are and what they're trying to achieve and fix in the system. so they'll be able to pretty much implement with some sense of direction and information. that's what i would propose.",42,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"so, from your standpoint, what are the key issues that the ppp that aims to improve lab diagnostic services should focus on or include to be successful?","i think that's a very pertinent point, definitely good management or, bad management can break the whole process or break that whole project. so it's very vital, those are things that come up during the contract negotiation that you're putting in, and adequate team, a team that is skilled and knowledgeable in this part.and this is where ppp really comes to help because one of the objectives of a ppp is, public bodies are relying on private sector capacity and expertise, as well as even financing. so, really, you know as a government institution, as a public entity, you are looking to the private sector and you partner with them to bring in that extra level of skill set that you might not have in house, or even if you do, private sector could compliment it. so, during the negotiation, it's important that parties align on what the management will look like. what decision making processes will be in place to govern the project.",43,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"and what about the management and finance and aslo the capacity, because when you started ppp you had also to ensure that you have the capacity in your institution. what do you think about that?","well, i don't know if i can specifically answer for lab diagnostic. i would probably give advantages and disadvantages i guess of pursuing a ppp. really most of the advantagesyou have an ability to share risk between partners.so that's between public and private. usually the risk will be allocated to the party that is more equipped, or best equipped to handle it and to deal with it. so it could be financial risk, technical risk whichever it is, but there is that advantage that you can share risk for purposes of the project. you also then have the ability to rely on private sector financing. it also relieves the public sector off you know spending so much to certain key areas such as health, educational, housing whichever it could be this allows the public sector to free up a bit of its budget, depending on its contribution towards the ppp, then you also have, as i said, the ability with a ppp in long term. so you're able to even plan futuristically for your community, for your society. it truly provide some comfort of knowing you taking the necessary steps at the beginning, you've procured the best person, and negotiated with them a solid contract. and this is going to govern an asset or a resource for quite a long period of the time you know you need that project will benefit the community for years to come.",44,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"what are the costs and benefits of pursuing ppp, especially for lab diagnostic at this stand? ","i think it's very supportive. initiatives have been made to ensure that first of all the legal framework is up to date. actually, with the business needs of the society, and also as provided for such different categories of where ppps can be used to, it's been more structured. and that really provides more clarity, between partners. so i would say the legal framework is very supportive. it's very relevant, it looks at the different scenarios and has highlighted key sectors of the economy that are very instrumental in helping people in facilitating even better service delivery in the country.",45,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
and the next question something that have a legal background so how supportive is the existing policy legal and regulatory framework for ppps.,"i think there was a lot of resistance at the very beginning when, especially the new law and policy were being introduced. there was definitely a reservation on choosing to use a more structured, i mean going through all the current steps that are provided under the law. most people thought it is too lengthy. they thought it would really take up a lot of time. it might even maybe push away the private sector, they thought people will lose interest when they see how extensive the process is.",46,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
so based on your experience how much resistance do you see among policymakers to ppp?,"i'm sorry i maybe don't understand that question by flexible you mean, can you change to another model?",47,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
and how flexible is the ppp to changes for example in government priorities.,"that may be a bit tricky. especially as i have said if you have taken it to the right processes, according to the law. that may be a bit difficult. you might have to then terminate it, and then start afresh and choose another option if that is what parties have decided.",48,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"yes, yes",and when you say a different model what do you mean a financial model? or for instance when you have decided to build on transfer ppp and then for instance you want to change it maybe to a joint venture is that kind of change you're talking about?,49,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"okay, so if we want to change something in the ppp, because we came up with a model and then we realized that maybe we should refine it and changes to a certain different type of model. so that means that will need to terminate it first? ","okay. the important thing here is you have to be clear on what you're calling a ppp what you're calling privatization. what you're calling a sale, because you have to be careful not to mix up these terms. the law clearly provides what categories of contracts or niche agreements would fall under a ppp. so i think we have about four or five just double check. there's a build on and operate. thatâ€™s where may be government allows you to build on that asset and allows you to operate it. and then there is a build on and transfer where at the end of a specific term that asset it will be sent, transferred back to government.we have management agreements as well. and then we have lease operate and develop. so where the government will lease an asset, operate it and then develop it at some point. yeah. now when you bring in something like privatization in its strict sense means that you're relinquishing all ownership rights over an asset. so you're giving it away completely to the private sector, forever. you're not going to then come back and say, you know, give me back my asset, because they've paid for it. the private sector is now the owner, that is privatization and that's completely different from what ppp is.",50,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"all changes especially here for the lab diagnostics so they have different models so some models where they were proposing for example, co-management between the government and the private partner, and the model all where we will just decideto go for privatization.","so in that case, if it's a co management. you know that wouldnâ€™t go through the ppp process as provided by the law. i think that's something, then either the hospital or through moh or rbc, can then maybe put out a tender, looking for co-managers, you get a pool of interested people you select, and then you get into those separate co management agreements with them. so that would be, pretty much just take on an ordinary contract arrangement, as opposed to a ppp that's more detailed and has to go through a feasibility study process, clearance and that sort of thing. so, coming back to your question of can it change? it would make more sense if it's a lease operate and develop for example, at the beginning, that's what parties have agreed to have negotiated.",51,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"i read the document and looking at the description and characteristics, it looked like the new that one the lease operate and develop. give the lab sector, the lab network to a private partner that has expertise in how to manage these labs. the different labs that we have in the country. and that question that company that private partner will operate these labs but also develop for a certain period of time.was co-management so that the government will have some responsibilities with, and the private partner also will have some responsibilities.",i haven't seen parties switch the nature of the contracts especially with the ppps because they've really taken a lot of time to negotiate at the beginning. and really tried to factor in all risks you know all possible mishaps. you know there are so many things that have gone into that process. so it's a bit hard to tell if someone can just change i haven't seen that in practice in my time here.,52,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"all the other way around coming from the management, this lease, operate and develop, so you have never seen that.","i haven't seen that many ppps in health, there's one that we're hoping will take effect they are still at the feasibility study stage. it looks promising. they have taken quite a long time developing the feasibility study, but that is because it went to the process provided for under the law, so they are expected to have that feasibility study done approved by the contracting authority submitted to the steering committee, before it progresses to contract negotiation.but the rest of the contracts we have seen in health you know they're outside the ppp format. so you'll have management or service contracts you know between the public sector and the private partner.",53,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"historically, how the public and the private sectors are focusing on health, how have they interacted in the past years?",you mean between the private and public?,54,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"and the collaboration between two partners how do you find it? is this like they trust really each other, does the relationship really smooth between the two partners.","i think there's a lot of good faith, between the parties, there's a lot of collaboration. i think it's an area that both partners are willing to explore willing to get into business on with. so, i think it's very good i think it's very positive.",55,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"yes, the private and the public sector, especially in health.",if either one i've seen and if you're talking about ppp according to the law. just for clarity.,56,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"so, you said something that i want us to better understand you said that the most of the contracts for the health sector are out of the ppp.","well, maybe just also for your own reading the current law is called its implementation of the law number 14/2016. in second may 2016 governing public private partnerships. so, that was passed about 2016, 2017 i believe. let me just pull up the exact definition so that we may be clear for the get go.",57,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"okay. so, can you tell me according to the law, what is a ppp, just for me to better understand?","i have not seen it yet, i have no idea.",58,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"thank you, this makes things more clearly.",i haven't dealt with that particularly but if i was to speculate i would assume that's something that you negotiate and agree on how management will work.that's all i can think of.,59,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"yeah. the next question is, how health system governance arrangements affect the design of the ppp, you know, i think it's also applicable to the administrative governance that then the governance in general that we have in rwanda,","yes, i would advise that too.",60,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"especially if you are implementing the ppp and you have this different level of decisions. who is going to be held accountable if it's a ppp that is going to be implemented at the lower level, and you have these two layers of decisions?",i don't know if i can answer that.,61,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"yeah. so, meaning that one when you are working on the ppp this is something that you should plan ahead and negotiate and set it clear.","no, i have not. ",62,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
next question is asking. maybe you may not have much information about that. but we are looking at investments and interest from the government in lab diagnostic.,"it really varies from forestry to agriculture to tourism to ict to energy, mining to mention few.",63,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"so you've been working in different sector except from the ppp that you were just mentioning that is currently ongoing, have you worked on any other ppp in the health sector before?","i haven't seen that many people up in the health sector, genuinely, this is theone that we are hoping will be materializedbut as i said it's at thefeasibility study stage.",64,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
so you've been working mainly in which sector.,"they will not. sometimes they will still negotiate them but they won't go through for instance the ppp steering committee, they most likely will not have feasibility studies done, which is very pertinent for ppp project you must have a feasibility study.",65,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"is this because there are few people in health sector or, because maybe by chance you just don't work in health.","align ministry so ministry of health. you might want to have ministry of finance in case any budgetary financial contribution. and i guess i don't know who else was under the ministry of health with any technical parties would be good as well. maybe rbc as well, depending on what objective is.",66,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"okay, interesting. but then, all the service contracting,so that means that this doesn't go through rdb, no.",you would have to depend on what the project is about and what the objective is.,67,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"so, okay then for a ppp who are the stakeholders that should be involved, when you're developing a ppp. let's say we have this ppp in health, what are the key stakeholders that should be involved.",i'm not sure i think that would be a decision for a centralized level to decide who they would need for the purposes of developing the ppp and the discussion.,68,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
no any other like government institution?,what do you mean in driving the ppp mean the process or actual implementation of the project? ,69,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"so yeah, and do you have for example this one was around laboratory diagnostics. so what about the health facilities should they be also involved in developing the ppp","i think that would really depend on what the ministry would lead on the technical part, it would come in with some district i don't know whoever feel is necessary for the purposes of the project. they might be instrumental in reviewing the feasibility study findings, develop with a private partner and give feedback. i think that is maybe a crucial role that they can play, and definitely provide any technical input during contract negotiation.",70,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"but then, when we look at these key stakeholders. what is their influence in driving the ppp?","we come in at the point of contract negotiation. again, that's also provided for another look on what our role is.",71,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"the process, because we are still at this phase of the process. so especially when they are designing the ppp and when it comes to negotiations.","we lead the negotiations we help draft conduct the meetings; we review, we take the project documents through the internal approval processes, we ensure that all the parties concerns are catered for we try and get the best positions for each party, and then ensure thatâ€™s reflected in the document. ",72,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"and what about rdb you didn't list, actually it's now, rdb before the key stakeholders, when you're developing the ppp shouldn't rdb be there?","i think i would defer to the investment court; i am sure there are some benefits that are provided for generally incentive that would be enticing to investors in any sector, there are some that are very generalyou have the corporate income tax holidays, you have immigration incentives, you might also input duty incentives where you permitted a certain incentive the importing equipment what a certain amount. i think those are the things that would drive private sector interest. and that's what government has done to create a favorable investment climate. for those particular reasons. so i would defer to the investment court. definitely i think during your research you can definitely look at the incentives dedicated to the health sector and get an idea of what would drive private sector involvement in that.",73,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"and doing now, contract negotiation. what is your role?","i think that the drawbacks are, iâ€™m just speculating i'm not sure.",74,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"and then, so how based on your experience with other ppp how interested are private partners to participate in the ppp. for instance what are their incentives to participate, what are their drawbacks?","i think health is a very sensitive sector. i think it's one that has been predominantly and historically led by governments. very people centric so you have to be careful with how you manage such service, you know, things like education and health almost put them in the same category, they're very particular with how they should be handled so i think you know you have a bit of that may be reservation but the bit of it is that you know these are sectors that have also been evolving over time you have telemedicine coming up. you have so many innovations in the health sector coming up as well. and another thing government has done is to also move with the times and ensure that it's facilitating all these innovations. so that's why i'm saying when you look at the incentives. you know theyâ€™re really encouraging to innovators and investors not only in health sector but in various sectors, so the drawbacks would only pick up the sensitivity of the sector, that may create some level of a drawbacks, but you know people are getting more creative every other day.",75,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
and then what are the drawbacks?,"it would be based on the findings of the feasibility study that will inform how you should design it.that's why i would say it depends on what the findings are, what the financial and technical viability looks like. you look at the partiesâ€™ strength and then you decide which format under the law would make more sense to both of you.",76,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
there is no problem it's based on what you learned.,"i think that would be informed still by a feasibility study it should show you how viable the project is, so you'll be able to determine how you can sustain it.do you need to take out a loan? how are you going to finance it? do you have enough equity, you know all those things if you're going to look at the kind of equipment you're using, what are the management costs related to it, is it something that you can sustain? i think your feasibility study if you take good time to develop it, that informs you because you might bring information to then implement the project correctly and in a sustainable manner.",77,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
this is the last question for you. how the ppp could be designed to achieve scale up and sustainability.,"no, thank you.",78,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"and then for sustainability when we go for ppp we want something that will actually address the challenges the issues that we have in whatever systems we're working with, if someone wanted to get working on a ppp in whatever sector. so what would you advise especially for the sustainability component? what should we look at? ","if we can go back a little bit, actually i was going to ask you. have you spoken with dm of nrl?",79,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"so, this is the last one, but this is for you actually so if there is anything that you would like to add on what we have discussed.","yeah. because actually, this is my first time to participate in anything on ahdp of course, other ppp projects, such as abbott and others i have participated but this is the first time for me with ahdp, i think i'm not the right person, i donâ€™t know it.",80,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
"thank you for your time. and we're very glad that you've been able to find some time to discuss with us. and this will help this evaluation, and it will be really helpful for us to understand better the ppp process and ppp implementation at the country level, that will help also this evaluation that we are doing for the ahdp project.",okay.,81,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_9
so the first question that we have for you is to ask you to describe your involvement in this ppp process for the ahdp. at what point where you involved?and what were you doing? what was your role?,i think i know about those assessment that was done.,1,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
division manager?,then i understand.,2,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"so, we talked with the division manager, we had also plan to talk with the former head of department of biomedical services.","okay, then i understand. all right, so we may go ahead.",3,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"so, the ahdp, maybe i can give you more details in 2019 i think chai was the technical assistance for that particular ppp. so this was a ppp that was supposed to be financed through the european investment bank, they had some funds for that and then, chai was providing technical support, they worked with the nrl team, and as well as the ministry of health team.first of all, they did some assessment of the situation at that time, to see what the challenges that we have are in the lab diagnostic system.","so, just like you said few years back, 2018-2019, there was a gap seen in the lab networks, we had to assess the available resources how we can distribute equally how we can optimize to improve the services in laboratories across the hospitals.so, i remember that the first time i was involved was in the preparation of technical documents during the need assessment. i was invited to the meeting to provide biomedical engineers to support the program, we had someone assigned and then this person participated whether for the site visits in the hospitals, and then collection of data, development of reports, as it moved forward. i also participated in a workshop to approve or to validate the final proposals, the outcome of the surveys i think that was my involvement in the process.",4,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"from there they did, i think a feasibility study where they came up with the different options for the ppp that went from, i think sample transportation, then they started with something like co-management, privatization,they had a lot of discussions around that. so, the questions that we have here ask your involvement. this will depend on your involvement actually in the process. ",i know it was in rubavu. but i would have to check,5,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"so then to clarify that it would be interesting for you to explain to us what your real role at what were you involved? what did you do exactly?did you have like a specific role at the forefront, or were you more like at the back, something like that. yeah.","there is one that happened in kigali may be in this hotel, i am not remembering the name exactly. itâ€™s also about the validation of these.",6,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"okay, so can you describe your involvement in this ppp process.","yes, that's the case. i think the rubavu one was the nsp it wasn't about this, it was the laboratory national strategic plan.",7,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
and can you remember when this workshop happened?,"i think so, we got too many but i think that is the correct answer.",8,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"was it last year, or 2020? and you were talking about the workshop where you were invited for the validation of the findings in rubavu.","yes. we have assigned a biomedical engineer who was in charge of the laboratory equipment, management, and this person participated in the process as well.",9,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"okay, and actually chai was the one leading, organizing and presenting the results of what they did.","yes, it's an engineer.yeah, he is currently still in the position.",10,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
the rubavu one?,"yeah sure, feel free. ",11,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"okay. so, you told me also that someone from your department was involved in working with the team when they were working on the needs assessment, right? ","i don't think i can provide much more details on that. i was not really involved in the ppp negotiations.what i know is the process usually goes through rdb and it depends on their terms, it depends on the responsibilities of each party, but i really didn't participate actively in the development of the ppp.",12,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
is he still working with rbc?,"no, not so much.",13,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"okay, maybe we'll reach out to him also.",the findings. that's correct. ,14,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"thank you. so, the next question we want to better understand how the process of negotiation of the ppp. how did it go? if you can describe how the process was undertaken.","assessment. yeah, that was about the findings of the need assessment and proposal of redistribution to ensure optimized service delivery. after i didn't go into the next steps.",15,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"and then, if we talk about now the different models that came out of, you know they did the feasibility study presented at the end, some models. so were you involved during the discussion around these models which one should we, for example, implement versus another? did you participate in such meetings?",it was mostly about identifying where different systems or more than one system are installed and not being used optimally. whether those services are needed in another hospital health facility that could use the same system and then they identify the placements and proposed redistribution equally.,16,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
so the one you went at that hotel was just validation of the findings.,"no, i don't think so, but that's why i was asking if you spoke to dm because he would be much more informed than me, otherwise i didn't really follow after the validation.",17,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
findings of the need assessment? ,"no, after the technical part, we did not participate further, even the engineer i mentioned did not.",18,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
okay. and what if you don't know if you still remember these propositions of redistribution. what did they exactly presented ? ,"i can share his contacts, maybe he can also tell you",19,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"yeah, the equipment that were available in the system. you said that you didn't participate in the discussion around the selection of the model to implement especially when they were discussing the ppp design because we wanted to know, how it happened during the discussion and what were the sticking points you know those points where people are discussing a lot, and not agreeing?","no, not really.",20,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"what were those points and then how were they resolved. if you didn't participate, then it's going to be difficult to answer that. but i think you are aware of what was going on and i would like to know if you knew the institution or individuals involved in the design of the ppp.",not really.,21,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"oh, okay. actually, we talked to him but we wanted to talk to as many people as possible to gather more information.so then, after the meeting that you attended for the needs assessment for the rest of the activity who was involved, or even for him he wasn't involved in the discussions, especially on the design of the ppp.",except for the documents that you shared i hadn't heard about ahdp.,22,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
okay,"well, itâ€™s very difficult question very broad, but i think ppp is possible in lab diagnostics especially in providing, specific equipment with the manufacturer, where they provide a machine and then we pay on test or reagents procured. but there's another way of that can be having to outsource some of the tests that were supposed to be done by the lab, outsourcing them to a more mobile, or, let's say quick people who can quickly intervene to serve the population, some can even find those patients at home instead of them moving to the hospital or to the lab. so, i know that it is possible and it's being done in other countries, where they have well established laboratories and the government outsource some of the testing, even high containment requirements, testing. so, it could be interesting to see here in rwanda, and it will definitely solve few of issues that exist currently.",23,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"you said that your involvement was at the beginning, when you had to provide technical details and then to help in the needs assessment. so, i was asking when the feasibility study was available with the different ppp designs or models that were proposed, were you not involved or attended in any meeting where they presented these designs?",i can imagine. ,24,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
we see then you haven't heard about anything about a ppp for the lab network. i was actually looking at the questions that we have based on your feedback.,"somehow, they address some of the important issues that we had such as availing reagents on time and also having to plan together for payment ahead of time. but it is a bit limiting as well because in case they don't perform well there is delay and you always have to wait for the same person to handle the tests. also, they can choose to perform well, or limit in their expertise i think we have had some case where all the promised services were not provided as it is written in the contracts. so, there are pros and cons to the ppp that exists already. but i would say that, comparing to the non-ppp the other contracts that we have there for equipment, it is far better. currently, having a ppp is far better than having to depend for ourselves to buy an equipment one by one.",25,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"you didn't have any information about this ahdp-ppp. so nothing about, no discussion around the co-management that they proposed at some points or about the privatization.","to some extent yes, but not at the beginning but during the management of the contract, and also during the renewal when i was in this.",26,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"okay. so let's then keep it in general, based on your knowledge of the lab network that we have and then as a biomedical engineer, you know, so the equipment that we have, would you thinkfor example how should an ideal ppp accommodate the needs of priority population for example if we have to designa pppfor public private partnership in lab diagnostic, how should it be designed so that we accommodate the needs of our priority population like the poorest households , andpeople with very complicated diseases.","the first one is, maybe to ensure that the terms are beneficial to both sides equally. because after signature one must ensure that the services are being offered continuously in quality, quantity and in a safe manner. but also, we saw that there was less capacity building for the ppp system, so i would definitely focus on having some capacity building for the hospitals which can benefit both the supplier and the client, in terms of having someone who can do small repairs who can do preventive maintenance and then who can do troubleshooting so that the services are not delayed or stopped. and the supplier would still keep some of the most important or the difficult services to handle so i would say that i would look at the terms very carefully and have them benefit both parties, especially our people in the field.",27,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"so, it's very difficult when iâ€™m looking at keeping it general not going into this ahdp-ppp ","so, i would say the most important is the patient the beneficiary, and why, because they're the ones who receive the services, the services should be the best they can get at time also with providing full information. i would also think hospitals or other clinicians, because having a good network with good machine of full best options that are operational can be an advantage. so, they are very much important in the network.",28,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"yeah, when you look at the ppp that we have currently let's use the ppp that we have currently in place in rwanda. do you think that they address the real needs of the people, and if no, what are the areas that we can improve and how can we improve those areas?","again, i would say we wish who benefit the most is the patient, still they are the ones who benefits most of the time. because that is what we are doing to satisfy the clients the ppp is solving a problem in terms of quality in terms of time and services.but if you consider the contractor and the partner, or if you consider the government and the partner. i think they both have the same stake. they both have to ensure that they will provide the services to their satisfaction of the other party.",29,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"and then, were you involved in other ppp for example the ppp with abbott",any institution?,30,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"and then, what can we learn from this experience? what are the main lessons that you learned from or still learning even from this ppp?","depends on which point of view, where are you coming from. if i'm to speak as a government employee i would say it will depend on the benefits that the government will be getting.and in this case, i think, no one is being threatened because it's an added value for the people for the government, there is some improvements because this is reducing the investments that are being done irregularly or the problem of not giving the full services that we want, this can solve the problems of delay.",31,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"when you do a ppp like this, were there key stakeholders and why were they involved?","yeah, in rwanda there are lots of companies, i can think of about 10 supplying lab equipment.but they are more than 10.",32,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"so, the next question is about we are looking, we want to know who benefits the most when there is public-private partnership lab diagnostic who do you think benefit the most?","yeah, different types of equipment of lab equipment.",33,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"yeah, i was asking this question because the next one is really to try to understand is there anyone or any institution that can be threatened by the fact that the government is going into partnership with a private actor in the lab diagnostics? ","so, mostly for lab, we see ppp happening for big equipment those that require a lot of reagents those are the ones often used as they are the ones that accept to have ppp kind of contracts, and also there is a portfolio that is required because smaller companies, smaller firms they don't, like to wait, they prefer to sell and just leave. so it's mostly the big equipment, those that require a lot of reagents, and those that are backed by an important portfolio.",34,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
yes,"so incentives, there are two kinds of incentives, there is one which i will not maybe have more details on, the one provided by rdb. if a company that is coming to invest in rwanda or with an important portfolio, there are some incentives on taxes or on investment that i canâ€™t give the details of because i don't know, but with us, with rbc, with nrl, mostly we provide the support they need we might provide them space where to install their machines, even the way to work. there are different possibilities, which can be discussed, but the one that comes to mind is the availability of an infrastructure or a space where to work from.and, of course we planned together and we gave the support technically, where they need.",35,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"okay. do we have many suppliers of lab equipment? apart from abbott, and roche, do we have others?","i think, as you know, the government of rwanda works with different development partners there are budgets provided by the world bank, global fund, cdc and i think that is going to continue with some point of course, i can't attest on that. but we are continuing to make inquiries contact new development partners i wouldn't say a final list, but those are the main ones.",36,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
they are more than 10?,"you know, the national laboratories presently improving on their services, to be able to monetize, some of the services and well not privatized but to get some income.so that's one way to increase the funds used in lab. but also, there are local partners, potential partners that are available we saw during this covid, a lot of rwandan companies responded to the call to support technically or financially and provided donations but also the partnership was good. so, i see potential as well for local companies, local institutions and also, of course nrl activities.",37,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"and the next question is about private partners, and if there is a ppp so how interested are private partners in participating in ppp, we want to understand what the main questions are when it comes to participating in the ppp. so what are the biggest incentives to participate in the ppp, and on the other hand what are the drawbacks for them?","maybe just one example is the covid19 testing services, theyâ€™re generating some income from that.",38,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
when you say important portfolio what do you mean exactly? ,"not really, just want to thank you for involving me and i would be happy to answer any follow up question.",39,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"that can be able to recruit local representative after installation those that can even bring reagents in advance and be ready to supply at a moment notice, and contracting with the government means that there will be emergencies. let's say if there's an estimation of the quantity that is needed, there will be always surplus or less. so, someone who was able to be flexible and is not threatened by small limitations or small challenges and can be able to have trained technicians who are ready to support technically for the maintenance repairs and everything at a moment notice. and also, most of them do not have replacement equipment, they can't afford to have equipment to supply once one is broken.","thank you dr. so, my involvement in the ppp project. firstly, from the sector level, ministry of health with the partners in this because we have been dealing with public private partnership projects, as usual in other sectors, and in this most diagnostic in better improving quality of service in the laboratory. we thought of also having a public private partnership for improved care. so my involvement in the project lead, has been coordinating the teams of this project that is from the ministry of health, their partners and rbc and also rdb, so i've been coordinating to this work, day and, right, the feasibility study showed us, as in areas of improvement in the quality of service delivered by our laboratories currently. and why do we need a ppp model. so my role has been the coordination role from the ministry level.",40,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"so, yeah, that's interesting. so what you have listed may be considered as drawbacks for some of the potential private partners that wants to engage in ppp.but then what are the incentives for them to come and work with you as the government what will motivate them, what are the different factors that can motivate them to participate?","as i said, we first had a problem statement, why are we going for a ppp. there was an issue of improving our quality of care, the delivery of services in the laboratories in public hospitals, and in line with also the national reference lab. this happened some years back, realizing that there were some inefficiencies and issues to deliver the quality of care in testing and result delivery being good on time, so leaders thought of what they can do to improve and they decide to do a feasibility study with the support of obviously different partners and rdb because if you want to bring in public private partnership then you involve rdb. but that was before we had to talk to minister we wanted to improve quickly, then they had to do the feasibility study, to see, i would call it like a situation analysis, what has been done and how can we improve what has been done you know for the quality of care to be achieved. so, the feasibility study showed different six issues that did the laboratory are facing in the hospitals.i cannot remember, most of them but i will tell you, one of them was in the delayed results delivery from where the samples were taken to from the patient,sampling site . but the diagnosis that will be made after the results delivery are good. so, one of the six recommendations was let us improve the sample transportation to have the delivery of the results on time. another one was also to improve the management how they did, so they could make some money and also the capacity of staff, you know, we had to sit back and say, okay, this has to be faced, we cannot take on over the six recommendations at the go? but where do we go first. and with that is most pressing for the country, maybe for the laboratories then we say,, let's first deal with sample transportation. and this would start with a piloting phase of a ppp, and then we see what this will produce. so the negotiation was around how it should be a first implementation of the recommendations from the feasibility study and phase one was sample transportation to be under that ppp. so, and that's where the negotiation started how do we start, do we start by piloting and then after six months implementing the sample transportation we would do transition to full co-management of this. the full ppp managing them, the whole laboratory services that was the plan actually after the results and assessment of the first ppp, that was the negotiation and that's where we are. ",41,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"what are, or, could be the plans in place to support public sector financing of diagnostic? so, for example, we have different sources of funding in rwanda for the health sector, what are these sources of funding that are expected to be used for financing the lab diagnostic? so now we have some source of funding but in the future, are we thinking about other source of funding?","yes, yes. sample transportation only",42,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"yeah, and then locally, if you think about domestic resources, they need plan on how to leverage on these domestic resources to increase funding for lab diagnostic to support just like lab diagnostic in the future?","second would be a full, co-management, like lab co-management, like the private person who would take on some staff hiring/firing, new equipment supply chain all of that would be transitioned to the private partner. even though it would be transitioned to full co-management still moh, rbc would have the oversight and coordination, but actually the partner will be taking all of that.",43,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"so, you were saying that nrl is improving services to generate more incomes. so, can you give more details on that? so, what are they exactly doing and these incomes come from people who are using services and which services exactly?",thank you.,44,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"okay, so we tried to give the conversation, broad on ppp in general because based on your feedback you were not involved in the ahdp- ppp design process. ","i will say let start by the facility selection of what we had, like how the project look like let me focus on the first phase which i talked about the partial, how these are organized we had to sample out facilities, i will explain this when i will address the question of how the facilities were selected. first of all, we looked at the facilities in different hospitals, and their health centers in different provinces of the country according to geographical distribution. and why did we select, what made us choose those hospitals, we looked at. first of all, the volume, what are the volume of samples that we get from these hospitals? secondly, what is the catchment area? if there is no nearby laboratory that were were struggling to have the specialty laboratories lab tests not done. ",45,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
and so is there anything else you would like to discuss or add to this discussion on public private partnership in the lab that we did not discuss but you think that this is something important that we should know.,"yes, actually. the criteria why we selected them, they had satellite labs, because the way the project was designed was, we could have these satellites labs, be like, call them what sampling sites, i think like where the hubs is. the lab samples were brought at the satellite siteshubs , and they were collected at the hubs, then they are tested and results are given back, and those samples that wouldn't be tested at those satellite labs, then they're transported to the national lab. but those selected were like those used as the hubs in those provinces. criteria number two, the catchment area i talked about is attached to every hospital, we considered these catchment areas with its surrounding health centers within each hospital, i think they were around 59 centers, and six hospitals, i don't remember numbers well, because i don't have the numbers here sorry for that but the hospitals must have the catchment area thatâ€™s how health center was also considered.",46,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"okay, thatâ€™s good. thank you. thank you very much for taking your time to discuss these ppp and also thank you for being open to any follow up questions in case we have.","yes, then they are brought to the hospital that one which has a satellite lab which make it called a hub.",47,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_10
"so, i will start with the first question asking you to describe your involvement in the public private partnership process, and the african has the diagnostic platform in rwanda.","what i saw along the areas of negotiation, the providers from rbc side. what we were looking at would be, how the ppp would look like in sample transportation, and this is a private person coming in the laboratory. and how would the lab be separable from the hospital. there were those worries, how are we bringing in this private person operating in the public hospital. and how the quality and the management would be assured in this. but this was discussed on and according the design, this was settled for the m&e. team framework were prepared to tackle and it was central coordinated transportation trucking, and also that trucking of delivery of samples and return of the result so this worry was discussed and was cleared. thatâ€™s was worry number one and worry number two was the expensive means of bringing in the ppp, the private person who will bring in increased costs on the test and there yet we have the mutuelle health insurance which will not cover the increase of cost in these tests, but we thought that this is going to be considered after the ppp model is agreed on. then it will be a discussion with the rssb to see how do we caterer. however, these were considered to be minimal like increment this small in the transportation cost for the samples, but it was needed to show what is the profit or the returnof investment to the government of rwanda is going to get from having a ppp instead of like working as a status core as it has been working. we thought why the government canâ€™t invest in improving the quality of laboratory services themselves as they know better the problem so then we change our status core instead of bringing in private person. then we discussed about the financial analysis and caches looking at the gains that the ppp model will bring up the growth that will be shared between the private and the government of rwanda after ppp timeline. we realized that it would take us a long time and much more investment to change the status core. ",1,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"thank you, i saw that you have been well involved in ahdp at the highest level at the ministry of health. and also, you were in charge of coordinating these efforts. ","yes, because you talked about the peripheral laboratories which make the satellite laboratories, rbc only one reference lab, national reference lab but now we look at the improved transportation because we have the peripheral laboratories, the satellites whereby it will not now need someone from gisenyi saying to bring their samples to kigali.",2,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"so, my third question that will be about the ppp design exactly? so, what was the process of negotiation over this ppp?","oh great, so i will tell you the stakeholders in thiswe had the minister of health taking the lead and coordination. we had rbc like implementing, who will be actually like the backbone of this for ppp project because they take care of laboratory services. we had chai, they were like development partner who was like, giving us technical support and who led the feasibility study with the consultants.",3,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
that ppp was the partial ppp.,minecofin was not yet involved.,4,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
the sample transportation would start first ? what was recommended next? ,"they were not yet involved.this was early discussion but this; if we could agree that this is the model, we would go to them because they will pay for this. the health insurances to pay for their patients, their clients,minecofin in terms of budgetif the ppp is approved at a technical level.",5,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"oh, thank you very much for this response.","right. chai was the one bill and melinda gates used to pass the money through from the aspect of finance. but they were also giving the technical support. this is a dual role of chai. they were like really supportive and like they were giving guidance during the technical discussions and was supportive. so, they facilitated, i looked at them now and, actually, they were facilitator, irrespective that they had that financial aspect.",6,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"how did this process vary by topic? if i can say so for example facility selection the procurement model contract type, including the referral network.","thank you. so, i would say it like this. as i told you there were six recommendations from the feasibility study on how to improve the quality of laboratory services. these six recommendations were grouped in two phases, as per our guidance, the moh choose to have a phased implementation or plan of the result of the recommendation.",7,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"okay six hospitals from different provinces. yes. well, except the kibagabaga i see those other hospitals with these satellite labs. ","yes. there was a lot that was done to improve the testing capacity to improve the transportation, and so on and so on.",8,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"so, the sample were transported from the health centers also?","to me the champion i think is rdb, rwanda development board. these are people who give guidance, these are people who actually even if there is a steering committee, the ppp will go there. they are like our support transport, hey are the champions.",9,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"that's very good. oh okay, what were the sticking points around the ppp design, and how were well they resolved.","yeah, they proposed this, and then we started engaging for the policy level to involve everyone. they call for an innovative way, or ppp or another way of addressing these issues came from rbc.",10,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"for the investment done in the lab, especially were caused by covid-19. so, what was the key point, was it like to see what will happen with this investment?","actually, during the course of all these negotiations, some discussions came in to improve our public laboratories without involving ppp because we are worried how to separate the hospitals from the laboratory because there was a worry.",11,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"thank you very much. thatâ€™s was very informative. so, who has been involved in the initial design of the ppp?","yeah, i think what this means is to learn how they improved, we come to learn about this.",12,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"what about minecofin,","it was from rbc side again, they were worried. but the hospitals, we had not yet engaged to them because you can never engage them when you are at the policy level and you have not yet agreed on this model.",13,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
what about the health insurance.,"it's the steering committee. all ppps go through the steering committee at the country level composed by rdb, moh and minecofin. all ppp initiatives are approved by the steering committee.",14,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"okay! you said that the chai was helping in the technical aspect, especially for feasibility study.but also, the chai was as the ministry of health development partner. on the other hand, biding for these ppp. so, having this kind of financial aspect. what do you think about that?can you elaborate a little bit of this aspect of market? ","with some people from the international, i don't know, but i will check, but you know ",15,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
yeah. thank you very much so.,but not at institutional level.,16,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"if i understand well, the cutoff point was investment done during the covid-19 ","i think i've been repeating these options. what we wanted was like you operate, and after five years you transfer back laboratory to the government to the public ownership. i'm not familiar with these terms, but this kind of management in the hands of the private partner for five years, and then after five years you transfer back the facility the laboratories to the government of rwanda. i don't know how they call it, but i've been seeing those terms. that's what's the option proposed.",17,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"so, have there been any champions, supporting the ppp? who has been championing the ppp in rwanda?","yeah, sure.",18,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"i do understand the rdb is championing all ppp because itâ€™s their mandate. but, regarding ppp in laboratories, who is the champion who brought the idea to the table to be discussed, did this come from rbc?","yes,",19,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"have there been any other actors, trying to propose the opposite direction from the main actors working in the ppp.",yes. thatâ€™s how the project was built.,20,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"and in india and kenya again, i think there were good results.","sort of complicated but not so complicated. to me, the appropriateness comes with what the country or the local context want. and this is what rwandaâ€™s case was, it was a good way that we already had wanted, and we proposed this. thatâ€™s why we went for a feasibility study. i think for the africa diagnostic health platform, its mandate or its work with the local context on the ppp was welcomed and was fitting in our need. ",21,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"these ideas to not separate lab from hospitals were they coming from the implementers such as the hospitals, or policy makers?","you know, in rwanda we have the ppp guideline. so, that is already a legal aspect of that. i think the context welcomes the ppp model.",22,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
okay! thatâ€™s very good.,"i will start with the poor. like you rightly mentioned, these people are covered by mutuelle, cbhi, and in the ppp the testsout the specialty testwere supposed to be taken care of. they are already covered, and only the copayment would come for the categorization number three. the vulnerable with the poorest are covered by the government of rwanda subsidiaries, and they are covered. meaning that even the ppp will accommodate the existing structure. ",23,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"so, which institution would have been ultimately responsible for approving the ppp design?","access was number one key recommendations. so, as we opted for sample transportation, in that phase one we are addressing access, because we wanted timely access of laboratory sampling and testing, and this was already addressed in the ppp model, ",24,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"rdb, moh, minecofin","as i told you, co-ownership was to improve on supply procurement and supply for affordability. this has to be the cost to be covered by the insurance, as the same has been in negotiation with insurance of cbhi. i think i've addressed for affordability and availability, what are the other two?",25,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
i think there is minefra also,"for efficiency and the quality, i mentioned about setting controls on how the samples are taken and delivered. not to lose samples on the way. so, this was also addressed in the monitoring platform that was proposed. that was to be centrally monitored by rbc, moh, and the partner was to address quality and efficiency. actually, we needed timely and cost-effective model that would be changing the status core, if we have seen that there are inefficiencies. we wanted to eliminate the inefficiencies and this was also the design that was considered.",26,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"what options were there? or, are still being considered on designing the model?","i don't think we have already a model, because we have not started it. so, i'm confused. i think we don't have it yet; we have a proposal.",27,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"so, the contracting options are like so.","they are dual, it is like you are supporting and then you are on the finance side. to me, that would be a conflict of interest. but actually, we expect professionalism in this because we are looking at you want to have quality of diagnostic services in africa, in the selected countries. so, what i look at as living finance control, nothing can happen without finances, but also the platform should support, technically, and advise. technically, because we are independent, we are looking at what is worth, that would work best for us.. the effect should be positive, not the other way around to push us to do. i see people declaring no conflict of interest but i don't know how it would work in this situation.",28,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
if i understood wellthe private would have everything to manage,"actually, i think if that is very straightforward if it is this case. there is no support on this ppp from the side of ahdp.so, their support would mean a success of the ppp. i think it would be more valuable to have ahdp supporting the ppp to come into existence, because i think that their facilitation is very positive for the ppp to exist. ",29,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
and the government would oversee and then they transfer everything over five years.,"i look at evaluation, because we need these evaluations at the point of implementation. so, this would be hard. if we don't have an evaluator. and i think this would be affected if i could not have the platform supporting the ppp. and also, technical support and facilitation along the process of the ppp which is key because we have experts.",30,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"and how appropriate is the design of african health diagnostic platform the ppp to the local context,","thank you. firstly, as i mentioned earlier, on the last statement i have mentioned, technical support you know the stakeholders in this project need to be for capacity to take on, and to lead the ppp discussions, and also the design. so, i'm looking at the ahdp starting in the starting phase of guidance and support discussions. and also, because you cannot come into the evaluation when you have not really supported the project. i understand you can't design and then evaluate, but also just to be sort of some technical support that is needed along the project to design and develop, and which improved the capacity of some the stakeholders in the project. so, that's my view on how i look at that technical support.",31,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"so, at the levels of policy legal framework. there was one? was it fitting all these levels?",i'm not clear on that maybe if you can simplify it.,32,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"so how would an ideal ppp design accommodate the needs of a priority population such as broadest household? there are complicated patients for example the comorbidities, the chronic conditions, how the ideal ppp design addresses the special need of mutuelle about the poorest households, the 25% of households whose mutuelle is paid by government.","oh, they have very much support to ppp as actually they allow a private investment in health. in terms of domestic resource mobilization for health, there were discussions on the initiatives on the african leadership meeting on domestic resource mobilization. so, i look at ppp as one way of investing, increasing private investment in the house in country. and if you look at the policy and regulation, i mentioned it earlier on, there is also an existing ppp guideline to allowprivate public partnership models coming into the health sector. ",33,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"that's very good. so, would the ppp design address a key consideration to improve access of laboratory diagnostic? if ppp is proposed?","most of the policymakers would like to maintain the quality. if we give the private to deliver the services we have been delivering, this private partner should be in position to convince or to show a model that considers quality ahead of other things. otherwise, it's a management modality that has to be negotiated and i don't think there is much resistance on that. so, the concern would be, how do we maintain quality or how to improve quality with the private person in the laboratory services. ",34,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"any elaboration on availability of test, the quality and efficiency also affordability in a ppp model?","one thing is that there are priorities in government that have to be achieved in different ways. also ppp is one of the ways like if we need to improve quality, if we need improve efficiency. so, in the lab this is one priority we have. you will find that there are existing policies and guidelines on that. i think this would be also a fitting way to address the priority of the country.",35,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
it was the quality and efficiency.,i don't think there are many things that i might know. but i can tell you about abbott.abbott laboratory has been one of the ppp models that has been working. may be african health diagnostic platform can learn or we can learn from that ppp design and implementation. ,36,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
so. which consideration is best served by the current design and why? ,"not really. i wasn't involved but i read, i read partly not deeply reports about the implementation. yeah, so, but i never involved in that.",37,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"so, now we move for the next question. the question is what were the factors that you think changed the discussion around the ppp that i think it was covered.","i think that should be trust should be good, because this is where we are going to, because we are increasing, we are attracting more private investors to invest in health. and you can't attract someone you don't have trust, but as there should be a control mechanism that the public should put in place to know if, actually, what has been agreed on is what has been what is being implemented the ground so that the population is protected. i think that's all i can respond to that.",38,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
if africa health diagnostic platform is providing the technical support. and the facilitating financing for this ppp. how would the availability of this support affect the ppp design? ,"yeah. thank you so. actually, i would say that the investment is heavy from planning and budgeting process. for the laboratories, they are planning to purchase and procure equipment and we consider training of laboratory technicians who will be trained and deployed. also, we consider supply of consumables used in the lab. i think that is heavy investment from the side of government.",39,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"maybe you would understand this in this way ahdp come without any conflict of interest, because it's just facilitated the ahdp do not look ahdp as chai. just. these are the melinda gates. there are european investment bank, and they are bringing in money, and also providing some technical support for. they are not, beading they are facilitating, chai.","at policy level, moh is very key because every day ppp has to be addressing the priority of the country. rbc, has to be there as implementers. and we also have health providers, these are the hospitals and they are very key. i will not forget the ministry of finance and economic planning.and also, the rdb is a key stakeholder for ppp. we also see our partners in health financing so these are very key stakeholders in the ppp model design discussions and also implementation.",40,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"so, the question is now how the availability of the support affect the ppp so, ppp would have an added value, and which one.",the advantage number one is to address the identified gaps in the laboratory. the disadvantage as i mentioned before is quality.,41,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"so, what are the features of the ppp design that would not be possible without ahdp technical support?","not all of them want it, but some have that ambiguity. the wonder if it will work well. for everything that is new, people will have to ask why we go for that. but they have to convince this with existence of this project elsewhere. and what were the results. and then i told you that this is tied to individuals. ",42,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"so, what are the features of the ppp design that would not. how would you recommend african health diagnostic platforms, technical support being used to address any gaps?","addressing the gap of inefficiency, timeliness, and also improve the supply chain of the consumables and functionality of equipment and technologies.",43,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
now we move from the following set of discussion questions about the context of the ppp design. the next question would be how supportive is the existing policy legal and regulatory framework for the ppp.,"on the incentives for private investors in rwanda, we have many of them. and among them. first of all, if you want to invest that should be favorable for you financially, the banks are already there without the corporate income tax. there's a lot from the rdb sides, that most investors interested in, but from the health sector, there is already an incentive of available workforce. and they will be working in your company ppp project, and they are skilled., then the clients. that is need and i think all the investors would be interested to invest where there is demand.to realize the return on investment, those are the incentives for an investor, but there are other detailed investments incentives from rdb side",44,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"so, considering the existing policies and regulations, and existing framework. how are they supportive to the ppp design?","i don't think this is a threatening point because these projects are not individualized. if there is a change in a position, it doesnâ€™t mean that everything is changed, and there is transfer of skills and knowledge, and also hand overs that are given to the changes in position. to me, i don't think this is a threatening.",45,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
so how much resistance among the policy makers will this ppp need to overcome?,i do agree,46,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"thank you very much. so, how flexible is the ppp to change according to changes in the government, or government priorities.","it's valid the concern. to have threats that will be sluggish, all like lagging back because of lack of information for the new person. the project will be moving, if someone changes, not every team, because the team is built, still the actors will be in position to onboard the new leader or the new position person that has come in, so that it doesn't hamper their progress of the project, and the working relationship of ahdp on the ppp.",47,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"yeah. so, what are other recent or earlier experience or a project to have there been in a country that you can provide the lessons for african health diagnostic platform. and that ppp that does exist in rwanda.","it is the population because we are delivering service to the population, also the government would be because its priority is to deliver quality service. thatâ€™s managed by the public or by the private but regardless of who provides these services, there will always be our population that is served.",48,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
were you involved in this?,benefit both ways. you want me to choose one depending on design? ,49,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"so, how trusting collaborative, is the relationship between public and the private sector for the health.","my perspective, i'll tell you that i don't want to be decided because if we look for ppp, we are looking for a solution to address the issue. so, i will not choose between the two. my opinion would be if we can improve it publicly without involving the private person, then we should do that. and then the beneficiary will be served. if we cannot do this, and we need more investment from the private investment that is ok, and then this investor should come in, to work to the standard on the quality of service that the government would want so that our population is well served. that's my opinion though itâ€™s not exciting, but it's just looking at what are the end results that we want to achieve.",50,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"well, thank you very much so. so, what has been the historic investment and interest from the government in the laboratory diagnostic? and what is profile of health workers, relative to the diagnostic system, including training, cadres","i think it's a win-win situation, because the government wants to improve the care and you as an investor you bringing in money to get return on investment. so, we should have a win -win situation. what have i invested and what have i gained and for the government, what have i achieved versus me not bringing this investor in this area?it must be a win-win situation.",51,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"that's very good. yeah. so, who are the key stakeholders in the ppp and why are they involved?","i think it not affects but it aligns with dynamics of the county level. because it's coming into the area of ppp, and we already have it so i don't see any effect on that. and it has to align to existing government guidelines instructions. ",52,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"how do they perceive, the advantage and disadvantage of the ppp.","i know but for the particular project we didn't go further, i think they would be interested because already have abbott, we have other private partners like lancet, you know.i think there will be in the same interest, but we didn't reach that stage.",53,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"so, people do not want the ppp.","the plans to me, i will go back to what i mentioned earlier. all along in the national planning and priorities setting and selections. in order to have improved access to quality of care, testing is vital. testing and diagnostics for the health care provision are vital. and this has been always considered in planning phases from the ministry of health and taking care of all these other needed equipment, infrastructure for the laboratories, and this have to be actually financed by either the government or external refunding through resource mobilization. as this is annually or each and every yearâ€™s process, itâ€™s sustainable. and because we have to tell to a funder to take care of our diagnostic services in country, as i mentioned, they might be from the government ordinary budget, but many from external funding through resource mobilization. so, the same would be for the ppp. if you have the plans, then they would be considered in the national plans.",54,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"yeah, and what are the advantages?",i mentioned them government and external funding.,55,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"that's good. so, what are the incentive to participate in the ppp? what would attract the private sector to invest in lab of the people?","not really, it may not be that because if sustainability will be there., government puts much of the percentage. i would say actually the inverse, government around 80%, and external 20%, even maybe 10%, because you cannot ensure sustainability when you rely on external funding",56,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"so, how threatening to the success of the ppp is the potential for turnover in key position among national actors.","it is straight but we don't have this already. so, i cannot respond to this.",57,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"yeah, i do understand, but today i may be discussing with someone, who understand things and tomorrow, i discuss it with the recent who may not understand.","oh, for specifically this we're talking about? ",58,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"and this is the reason of changing also the people, because the people are being changed for improvement like that. so, what do you say as that? as the health financing and the planning, policy.","oh, i donâ€™t think so.i wouldn't be talking of what has happened for with this specific project, but here we are not having it, we just stopped it, and we dumped it.",59,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"thank you very much. so, whose interest, helped or hurt by the laboratory diagnostic happening in the public versus private sector.","thatâ€™s whatâ€™s i said, that is three years now, on every year we look at the needs and there must be increase on what was needed on the previous year. i think maybe like 20% increase. that's a across the whole priorities that have been budgeted.",60,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"the population is hurt, or is benefiting in the public, or in private.","i think what we didn't talk about is only about the feasibility study. when should it be done? one of the challenges we faced was that time lag between when we want to implement and when was this study done, and we looked at the data and the data were not updated. so, recommendation would be doing timely feasibility studies. was like talking about these we were looking at the data of 2019? and that was one of the big challenges because when you want to implement ppp, it is very crucial as much has been covered ",61,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"it's not a matter of choosing, it's matter of delivering your perspective to some which way. the population will be benefiting with the public instead of private.",i will provide looking at what has been in place as i mentioned in the discussion.,62,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"who benefits, the most from a joint to public or private venture in the laboratory diagnostic.",no,63,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"so, how the structure of the african, health diagnostic platform project itself affect dynamics at the country level.",i heard about the ppp between discussions but we have never been involved in this.,64,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
thank you very much. so how interested are private partners in participating in the ppp? do you have some kind of historic background?,"i suppose this ppp should be a collaboration between the various partners to lead to a task. and in this case, i believe the task is to provide a better health care for the people in the country.",65,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"so, we are moving towards the end. ","i know some issues. yes. i know.i am the business person for many years, and i know somehow issues especially that we are facing in the lab sector.",66,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"but the following the one is only for your plan, because we wanted to talk about the sustainability. what are or could be the plans in place to support the public sector financing in the diagnostics in the future?","for us, we have been in the business of the laboratory and medical equipment for quite many years. we have worked here in the, in the country and we, i can definitely state certain problems, which, i see encountered in the health provision.number one is the procurement process. i believe there is a problem in the procurement process overall, with regards to you see the system here is that each laboratory gives the needs for their testing. and then this is all tabulate, centralized by may be rnl or rbc. and then there is a procurement process. now for me, i believe that sometimes sector nine teams are missing from the procurement so before they even start the procurement plan, they should consult with us and agree on a list of items that they are required for the process so things are not left out, okay imagine that in order to perform analysis, you need three components. if you buy the two components and the third component is not bought, then you cannot perform the, this is one of the problemsanother one is the training of the users of the facilities we have a case in rwanda one that apparently you have a high turnover of operators. let us see that today. you have somebody who works or is allocated to work with a machine. you train, he gets some experience. and after a few months, he migrates to somewhere else. and they keep on moving. so, the knowhow that they have for that machine is gone. then you have a treasure again. so, this creates a problem. okay why they are keep moving. i really don't know but, i see non stability in the operators.another thing which we encounter is the process of the procurement, you in the procurement an institution we used to deal with all different hospitals in the past. okay. so, an institution raises an lpo, has a contract. it raises an lpo. we deliver some products now to complete the procurement cycle. the hospital has to pay. we had a lot of difficulties of getting the money back. so, i give you the reagents. then i come to look for the money. then you have 1000 excuses then this obviously creates a problem. so how do i provide more products to you if you are, have not paid my previews provisions?another thing which is there is that as you know, that in rwanda, a lot of these analysis is covered by insurance. second of the products they are either not covered by the insurance or they are undercover to give you an example there is a test which is called for example, hba1c it's a parameter, which you analyze for the diabetics. and it is a very important to know, even the diabetic behaves in consumption of sugar. okay. now hba1c is one of the expensive parameters, and apparently, we find a lot of hospitals are not running the hba1c because the value which is covered by the insurance is very low. okay. because of the cost of the test, let's say that is $1, but the insurance covers half dollar then when you go to a patient, he has to cover the rest. maybe he doesn't have half a dollar to pay the rest. so the effect of that is that the analysis is not wrong. when you don't learn this analysis, you sacrifice the diabetic health and side effects. i also say side effects because you know that if, uh, uh, a patient does not, uh, monitor the glucose to a good level it has consequences. okay. you end up with side effects that they are serious and sugar, for example, it's an illness. if i can call it an illness, which is very silent, you don't have a pain, you don't have anything you don't have. there are effects that they come afterwards, but when they come, maybe it's too late you can have kidney failure. now, let me tell you, as government, as a system here, you don't pay $1. i just give an example about the value. you don't pay $1 to perform this analysis, and you could do analysis for the patient. let's say twice or three times a year. so is $3. you don't do this $3 expense, and you come after five years in five years, maybe you save $20, but then you have a patient who needs a transplant. ",67,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"yeah, so, which different sources of funding are expected to be used for financing the diagnostic?","okay. i will give you also an example here just to compliment my comments and comment on what you are asking. yes. is that in the past we had either sold or placed machines in the market. okay. and then the hospitals were purchasing from us at the time. it was the hospital each hospital was doing purchases. then about two, three years ago, we heard of a ppp to be done with abbott. so we had our machines, let's say in 50 hospitals and suddenly, and out of them blue, we had machines from abbott installed next to our machines in the same hospital. mm-hmm a lot of the hospitals, they stop buying from us. okay. obviously, they run out, they run on problems with abbott but also then they came back to us then whatever. so if the government wanted to do this partnership, you had a company which proposed that, oh, don't worry. ",68,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
at which proportion? because it's 80% external.,"from my side, as i said on before, when we discussed about 10 days ago, we will have no problem to work with the government or any other organization providing goods and services in a way that these are used efficiently and producing results for the patients.we are here. we said that we have a lot of instruments in the market. we can also assist in sometimes bringing in extra machines for placement or for selling you see, there are models that you can place a machine. yeah. you place a machine, but then you sell your reagents at the somehow higher price in order to make up for your investment. but here in rwanda, i find out that the people do not respect so much the placement model. ",69,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"so, a very specific one. if you have information, but you have a planner. so, how does the government include the financing support to the diagnostic and during the ppp period?","i believe it should be the ministry of health as a coordinator, because they are involved in the provision of the health services. yes, it should be funders in case of money needed from funding or somebody who to provide the money, which is needed.if it's not from funding, then it could be government or something else and then i believe stakeholders like medisell who are involved in the flow of goods and services to the, this project. and then any other company with regards to organizing, to, let's say to have a control, to have i believe that this is what the participants will be. ",70,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"okay, how the budget to finance lab diagnostics has been increasing in the government.","we, we raise our issues. but they were not take into consideration. so if we are going to do a partnership, you know, like a placement, it's a ppp it's a kind of a small scale. ppp so if you enter into such a, an agreement, there has to be a security behind it. so if you say we have a contract for three years, at least you respect the contract for three years. so we have to ensure that the involvement, because you see, if you start the project, i have already doneall my investments. i put a lot of money and may be 50, a hundred thousand dollars hundred, $50,000. there are machines that they are even more expensive. so if i make this investment at day zero don't stop at day three months, because for your own reason again, i said, you prefer to use a different machine you understand.",71,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
yes.,"yes. from my experience, for example, for these laboratories, and it's not only one. ",72,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
how the government has been increasing the budget for diagnostic,"okay. for me as a company, when ask me to join you for a project okay. um, as i said earlier, i am company for profit okay. so, when we do the ppp i will expect that we work in a probably a great way. okay. define the, what each party will participate in the period expectation from each, from each side and then respect the suggestions from a partner ",73,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
is there anything else you would like to discuss about the ppp that we have not yet talked about.,stability and collaboration.,74,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"thank you very much for your time. i don't know when you open the door for ppp or ahdp. you said that you will come in again as we discussed, and i will be happy to come back to you. if you accept.","sometimes, it depends on the models and on the concept, we are a private company here.we have our expenses, our products, so maybe we have limitation in the money, which you can invest. so if you say, for example, now that you need two other machines, small machines for the small sites that they don't have in laboratory, we have small machines, now,in order for the project to work, you need the machines, then you need people to use and give service ofthe machines,train the operators",75,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_08
"so, the first question that we have in regards to this initiative is to understand if you are involved during the ahdp ppp process design process negotiation. ","you know, something that every organization builds up the capacity, according tolet's say turnover or according to its, needs the size can grow. you know? so if, for example you are asking me, i will give an example, although it may not be, if you are asking me, for example, to run a laboratory now to run a laboratory, it means that i need people machines, material. yeah. then i'm moving into a different level.i have here about 25 employees. i cannot run laboratories, but if let's say you say that, we don't want to manage the lab, you manage the lab. it means that every laboratory will meet a head count of 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 people, depending on the size of the lab so this obviously it's you move to a different level. yes. for a long time from here capacity can grow but again, to grow, that's what i said earlier. you need the stability and, you know, i cannot double my staff to accept, whatever is needed as input in the ppp and then next year, or next six months, these collapses you understand? capacity currently is not here, but can grow given that you are assure that it's going to be a long partnership and stable. ",1,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_13
"no. so, you didn't hear about this initiative before? ","the lab diagnosis? i believe that the government has to look for more stability on the, laboratories on the personnel, in the laboratories and then there has to be a good planning for the deliveries to be done. so the laboratories can run without any deficiencies they have to evaluate if more machines are needed in certain places yeah. okay.i don't know. and also the money to be available for the purchase, but i think that is okay. i believe that since you have the funders being involved, i believe there will be no problem there. ",2,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_13
"so, then i'm going to go to some questions that we have that are more general in regards to ppp so for you said that you have heard about ppp. yes. ","no what i do is a summary. what i will say is that be open with us in the private sector when you need the ppp because ppp it's a word thing that it was not here five years ago or 10 years ago. so, people may understand ppp in different ways so it's good to be very clear on what is expected in a ppp for a participant.",3,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_13
"how would an ideal ppp design accommodate the needs of people, the priority population that we have in our country? ","thank you too, i hope it will be helpful to some extent.",4,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_13
"you know, the context of rwanda, actually i think, you know, somehow the context, the different issues that we have? ",thank you. i'm not familiar with african health diagnostics platform. ,5,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_13
what will be an ideal ppp design accommodate the needs of priority populations for you that will address these issues? ,"no, what i attended back in 2020, it was a workshop, organized by chai and the ministry of health. they were exploring the possibilities of using ppp frameworks for laboratory services in rwanda, and they were discussing the pros and cons, looking at the different services and looking at that chain and also service delivery and which part of that chain would be most suitable to fall under ppp and which one wouldnâ€™t.and i remember we requested for the report out of that workshop i think chai was the one handling it, and we never received it. but my particular submission was mostly on the ppp processes that are provided under the regulations that we have and we were very clear that if you decide to take that ppp route, definitely, you must go through the processes that are provided for. and of course, as rdb we usually come in at the point of negotiation.",6,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_13
"what is for you? the ideal, like design, how you, as a private partner could work hand in hand with the government to improve the lab services in government facilities. ","during negotiations, though we have had instances in the past on different projects where you know the investor comes in, maybe either to us, or to moh, rbc, and has expressed interest in developing a project but we usually work with them through the process.so, in the feasibility study sometimes we might be sitting as part of the technical team, but by heavily led and supported by the line ministry.and then we gather input between financials, especially because we have some people who work on financials here. they will advise to see the viability of the proposed project, before we move on to approving it by the steering committee and then the contract negotiation.",7,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_13
"so, i would like to, because these ppp you were not necessarily involved in all the steps and negotiation but i would like to ask you if specially to talk about your experience in ppp with rwanda and how this new initiative can learn from what you have done in the past here in rwanda. ","i think, in order for ppp to be successful. i think the prior initial steps are very important actually areas of the feasibility study. i will think it's important that whoever is leading either the line ministry or the proposed investor has adequate data to develop a good feasibility study. and that's going to look mostly on the technical and financial viability of the project or a percept of that ppp. so that, i have found it very important during the ppp process and it really feeds and determines how successful or unsuccessful a ppp will be at the end of the day. the results of the feasibility study definitely also inform what would be put into the contract between the parties. it would really also give you a good understanding of what the project implementation will look like. because parties will have enough data and understanding what the findings are. you know what the loopholes are and what they're trying to achieve and fix in the system. so they'll be able to pretty much implement with some sense of direction and information. that's what i would propose.",8,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_13
"so, and how for you, what are these stakeholders that should sit around that table to be able to provide that information needed?","i think that's a very pertinent point, definitely good management or, bad management can break the whole process or break that whole project. so it's very vital, those are things that come up during the contract negotiation that you're putting in, and adequate team, a team that is skilled and knowledgeable in this part.and this is where ppp really comes to help because one of the objectives of a ppp is, public bodies are relying on private sector capacity and expertise, as well as even financing. so, really, you know as a government institution, as a public entity, you are looking to the private sector and you partner with them to bring in that extra level of skill set that you might not have in house, or even if you do, private sector could compliment it. so, during the negotiation, it's important that parties align on what the management will look like. what decision making processes will be in place to govern the project.",9,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_13
"so how would you during this example that you have provided of your the public private partnership with hospitals here in rwanda. so how would you i qualify the collaboration that you had with your public, counterpart. how was that collaboration?but was it still opened? were you able to talk to each other without any issues and clearly, and presenting the issues that you, you are seeing?","well, i don't know if i can specifically answer for lab diagnostic. i would probably give advantages and disadvantages i guess of pursuing a ppp. really most of the advantagesyou have an ability to share risk between partners.so that's between public and private. usually the risk will be allocated to the party that is more equipped, or best equipped to handle it and to deal with it. so it could be financial risk, technical risk whichever it is, but there is that advantage that you can share risk for purposes of the project. you also then have the ability to rely on private sector financing. it also relieves the public sector off you know spending so much to certain key areas such as health, educational, housing whichever it could be this allows the public sector to free up a bit of its budget, depending on its contribution towards the ppp, then you also have, as i said, the ability with a ppp in long term. so you're able to even plan futuristically for your community, for your society. it truly provide some comfort of knowing you taking the necessary steps at the beginning, you've procured the best person, and negotiated with them a solid contract. and this is going to govern an asset or a resource for quite a long period of the time you know you need that project will benefit the community for years to come.",10,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_13
"interesting.so, and then based on what you have just explained, um, how can this experience that you have how can it be used to improve the next ppp arrangement? ","i think it's very supportive. initiatives have been made to ensure that first of all the legal framework is up to date. actually, with the business needs of the society, and also as provided for such different categories of where ppps can be used to, it's been more structured. and that really provides more clarity, between partners. so i would say the legal framework is very supportive. it's very relevant, it looks at the different scenarios and has highlighted key sectors of the economy that are very instrumental in helping people in facilitating even better service delivery in the country.",11,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_13
"so let see so i'm going to ask you questions about the interest of private partners in participating into ppp yes. so if that private partners are called to participate in a ppp, like the ones that we are just explaining to you, so what would be your main questions? ","i think there was a lot of resistance at the very beginning when, especially the new law and policy were being introduced. there was definitely a reservation on choosing to use a more structured, i mean going through all the current steps that are provided under the law. most people thought it is too lengthy. they thought it would really take up a lot of time. it might even maybe push away the private sector, they thought people will lose interest when they see how extensive the process is.",12,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_13
and then what will be your biggest incentives to participate in a ppp,"i'm sorry i maybe don't understand that question by flexible you mean, can you change to another model?",13,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_13
and what are the drawbacks? ,"that may be a bit tricky. especially as i have said if you have taken it to the right processes, according to the law. that may be a bit difficult. you might have to then terminate it, and then start afresh and choose another option if that is what parties have decided.",14,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_13
"so do you think that if we were going to do something big like this, what do you think about the capacities of private partners in country in regards to that? they have capacity yes or no?",and when you say a different model what do you mean a financial model? or for instance when you have decided to build on transfer ppp and then for instance you want to change it maybe to a joint venture is that kind of change you're talking about?,15,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_13
what would be the plans in place to support the public sector financing for the diagnostics? can you just discuss some of the additional maybe resources and be used public resources that can be used to support diagnostic?,"okay. the important thing here is you have to be clear on what you're calling a ppp what you're calling privatization. what you're calling a sale, because you have to be careful not to mix up these terms. the law clearly provides what categories of contracts or niche agreements would fall under a ppp. so i think we have about four or five just double check. there's a build on and operate. thatâ€™s where may be government allows you to build on that asset and allows you to operate it. and then there is a build on and transfer where at the end of a specific term that asset it will be sent, transferred back to government.we have management agreements as well. and then we have lease operate and develop. so where the government will lease an asset, operate it and then develop it at some point. yeah. now when you bring in something like privatization in its strict sense means that you're relinquishing all ownership rights over an asset. so you're giving it away completely to the private sector, forever. you're not going to then come back and say, you know, give me back my asset, because they've paid for it. the private sector is now the owner, that is privatization and that's completely different from what ppp is.",16,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_13
"so, is there anything else that you would like to discuss in regards to ppp that we have not talked about up to now? ","so in that case, if it's a co management. you know that wouldnâ€™t go through the ppp process as provided by the law. i think that's something, then either the hospital or through moh or rbc, can then maybe put out a tender, looking for co-managers, you get a pool of interested people you select, and then you get into those separate co management agreements with them. so that would be, pretty much just take on an ordinary contract arrangement, as opposed to a ppp that's more detailed and has to go through a feasibility study process, clearance and that sort of thing. so, coming back to your question of can it change? it would make more sense if it's a lease operate and develop for example, at the beginning, that's what parties have agreed to have negotiated.",17,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_13
thank you then. thank you for your time and your experience that was shared.,i haven't seen parties switch the nature of the contracts especially with the ppps because they've really taken a lot of time to negotiate at the beginning. and really tried to factor in all risks you know all possible mishaps. you know there are so many things that have gone into that process. so it's a bit hard to tell if someone can just change i haven't seen that in practice in my time here.,18,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_13
"so the first question that we have for you is that we want to understand your involvement in the ppp process under the ahdp, the african health diagnostic platform in rwanda. so, and my question will be first to try to understand if you're familiar with the african health diagnostic platform.","i haven't seen that many ppps in health, there's one that we're hoping will take effect they are still at the feasibility study stage. it looks promising. they have taken quite a long time developing the feasibility study, but that is because it went to the process provided for under the law, so they are expected to have that feasibility study done approved by the contracting authority submitted to the steering committee, before it progresses to contract negotiation.but the rest of the contracts we have seen in health you know they're outside the ppp format. so you'll have management or service contracts you know between the public sector and the private partner.",1,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
so you have never attended any meeting where this was discussed?,you mean between the private and public?,2,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
"i have understood well so you come out quite late in the process, during the negotiations.","i think there's a lot of good faith, between the parties, there's a lot of collaboration. i think it's an area that both partners are willing to explore willing to get into business on with. so, i think it's very good i think it's very positive.",3,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
"but then as you were not actually involved in all the design, especially the design discussions because we were looking at how coming up with a final design, and all the discussions that happened before we come up with a final design and we're interested to get more insight into those discussions.but nevertheless, we still have some few questions for you. the most focused on ppp in rwanda. ",if either one i've seen and if you're talking about ppp according to the law. just for clarity.,4,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
"so, from your standpoint, what are the key issues that the ppp that aims to improve lab diagnostic services should focus on or include to be successful?","well, maybe just also for your own reading the current law is called its implementation of the law number 14/2016. in second may 2016 governing public private partnerships. so, that was passed about 2016, 2017 i believe. let me just pull up the exact definition so that we may be clear for the get go.",5,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
"and what about the management and finance and aslo the capacity, because when you started ppp you had also to ensure that you have the capacity in your institution. what do you think about that?","i have not seen it yet, i have no idea.",6,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
"what are the costs and benefits of pursuing ppp, especially for lab diagnostic at this stand? ",i haven't dealt with that particularly but if i was to speculate i would assume that's something that you negotiate and agree on how management will work.that's all i can think of.,7,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
and the next question something that have a legal background so how supportive is the existing policy legal and regulatory framework for ppps.,"yes, i would advise that too.",8,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
so based on your experience how much resistance do you see among policymakers to ppp?,i don't know if i can answer that.,9,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
and how flexible is the ppp to changes for example in government priorities.,"no, i have not. ",10,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
"yes, yes","it really varies from forestry to agriculture to tourism to ict to energy, mining to mention few.",11,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
"okay, so if we want to change something in the ppp, because we came up with a model and then we realized that maybe we should refine it and changes to a certain different type of model. so that means that will need to terminate it first? ","i haven't seen that many people up in the health sector, genuinely, this is theone that we are hoping will be materializedbut as i said it's at thefeasibility study stage.",12,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
"all changes especially here for the lab diagnostics so they have different models so some models where they were proposing for example, co-management between the government and the private partner, and the model all where we will just decideto go for privatization.","they will not. sometimes they will still negotiate them but they won't go through for instance the ppp steering committee, they most likely will not have feasibility studies done, which is very pertinent for ppp project you must have a feasibility study.",13,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
"i read the document and looking at the description and characteristics, it looked like the new that one the lease operate and develop. give the lab sector, the lab network to a private partner that has expertise in how to manage these labs. the different labs that we have in the country. and that question that company that private partner will operate these labs but also develop for a certain period of time.was co-management so that the government will have some responsibilities with, and the private partner also will have some responsibilities.","align ministry so ministry of health. you might want to have ministry of finance in case any budgetary financial contribution. and i guess i don't know who else was under the ministry of health with any technical parties would be good as well. maybe rbc as well, depending on what objective is.",14,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
"all the other way around coming from the management, this lease, operate and develop, so you have never seen that.",you would have to depend on what the project is about and what the objective is.,15,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
"historically, how the public and the private sectors are focusing on health, how have they interacted in the past years?",i'm not sure i think that would be a decision for a centralized level to decide who they would need for the purposes of developing the ppp and the discussion.,16,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
"and the collaboration between two partners how do you find it? is this like they trust really each other, does the relationship really smooth between the two partners.",what do you mean in driving the ppp mean the process or actual implementation of the project? ,17,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
"yes, the private and the public sector, especially in health.","i think that would really depend on what the ministry would lead on the technical part, it would come in with some district i don't know whoever feel is necessary for the purposes of the project. they might be instrumental in reviewing the feasibility study findings, develop with a private partner and give feedback. i think that is maybe a crucial role that they can play, and definitely provide any technical input during contract negotiation.",18,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
"so, you said something that i want us to better understand you said that the most of the contracts for the health sector are out of the ppp.","we come in at the point of contract negotiation. again, that's also provided for another look on what our role is.",19,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
"okay. so, can you tell me according to the law, what is a ppp, just for me to better understand?","we lead the negotiations we help draft conduct the meetings; we review, we take the project documents through the internal approval processes, we ensure that all the parties concerns are catered for we try and get the best positions for each party, and then ensure thatâ€™s reflected in the document. ",20,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
"thank you, this makes things more clearly.","i think i would defer to the investment court; i am sure there are some benefits that are provided for generally incentive that would be enticing to investors in any sector, there are some that are very generalyou have the corporate income tax holidays, you have immigration incentives, you might also input duty incentives where you permitted a certain incentive the importing equipment what a certain amount. i think those are the things that would drive private sector interest. and that's what government has done to create a favorable investment climate. for those particular reasons. so i would defer to the investment court. definitely i think during your research you can definitely look at the incentives dedicated to the health sector and get an idea of what would drive private sector involvement in that.",21,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
"yeah. the next question is, how health system governance arrangements affect the design of the ppp, you know, i think it's also applicable to the administrative governance that then the governance in general that we have in rwanda,","i think that the drawbacks are, iâ€™m just speculating i'm not sure.",22,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
"especially if you are implementing the ppp and you have this different level of decisions. who is going to be held accountable if it's a ppp that is going to be implemented at the lower level, and you have these two layers of decisions?","i think health is a very sensitive sector. i think it's one that has been predominantly and historically led by governments. very people centric so you have to be careful with how you manage such service, you know, things like education and health almost put them in the same category, they're very particular with how they should be handled so i think you know you have a bit of that may be reservation but the bit of it is that you know these are sectors that have also been evolving over time you have telemedicine coming up. you have so many innovations in the health sector coming up as well. and another thing government has done is to also move with the times and ensure that it's facilitating all these innovations. so that's why i'm saying when you look at the incentives. you know theyâ€™re really encouraging to innovators and investors not only in health sector but in various sectors, so the drawbacks would only pick up the sensitivity of the sector, that may create some level of a drawbacks, but you know people are getting more creative every other day.",23,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
"yeah. so, meaning that one when you are working on the ppp this is something that you should plan ahead and negotiate and set it clear.","it would be based on the findings of the feasibility study that will inform how you should design it.that's why i would say it depends on what the findings are, what the financial and technical viability looks like. you look at the partiesâ€™ strength and then you decide which format under the law would make more sense to both of you.",24,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
next question is asking. maybe you may not have much information about that. but we are looking at investments and interest from the government in lab diagnostic.,"i think that would be informed still by a feasibility study it should show you how viable the project is, so you'll be able to determine how you can sustain it.do you need to take out a loan? how are you going to finance it? do you have enough equity, you know all those things if you're going to look at the kind of equipment you're using, what are the management costs related to it, is it something that you can sustain? i think your feasibility study if you take good time to develop it, that informs you because you might bring information to then implement the project correctly and in a sustainable manner.",25,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
"so you've been working in different sector except from the ppp that you were just mentioning that is currently ongoing, have you worked on any other ppp in the health sector before?","no, thank you.",26,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
so you've been working mainly in which sector.,"yeah. so, my involvement came late. after the passing of sydney, our former country director of chai and she was the one who was leading on that project. and because i was taking over all the technical lead of the projects in the office. i was requested to take the lead on that. i had heard a few of the presentations before i had, you know, been involved in asking some of the key questions i wasn't yet fully on boarded at that time. and so, when i was tasked to take over, you know, technical support for that program, that's when i really sat down to understand it.",27,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
"is this because there are few people in health sector or, because maybe by chance you just don't work in health.","it started with a former minister of health and it started before covid and i think the vision at that time was really to improve the labs. overall, so it was a very holistic approach to improve it. and i think your question is interesting because pre covid the issues were a little different. the focus on labs was little different, the financing in labs was very different, during covid we started having a lot of attention on labs, not comprehensive, but still there was quite a lot of attention on investment and people started seeing the importance of labs. and then there was also the code drive i'm not sure when the decentralization of labs started.but i think that also affected you know the project as well so there's so many reforms that happened during the process of getting this project kicked off but when it started it was clearly agreed that it was going to be a look at how to holistic and improve lab services, such as your fast turnaround times you have quality lab services, and it's done. ",28,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
"okay, interesting. but then, all the service contracting,so that means that this doesn't go through rdb, no.","i think 2018.and the process in chai, because this was something that was very big for ira, not only ira, but, you know, the chai africa program. there are many countries that were pulled into this piece of work, beyond rwanda. and so, you know if your peer ghana, kenya. rwanda. and so, it was seen as a really big drive to improve labs in more than one country, and the countries that were selected for, you know for very strong reasons why the size of some countries to the progress of some countries. due to the financing the opportunity for success, the chance that this could actually succeed because countries were ready for some of these reforms and you know the interest of the leadership in each of the countries.",29,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
"so, okay then for a ppp who are the stakeholders that should be involved, when you're developing a ppp. let's say we have this ppp in health, what are the key stakeholders that should be involved.","okay. i don't have the current status, but i can talk about the part that i was aware of. i know that the assignment was given to the planning department. and for me, i feel like that because planning department handles ppp, but i feel like that was part of an error. because if it would have given to the lab department directly to the lab team, they could have developed it in a manner they understand what really needs to be done and they could have been taken along from the beginning. so, to put that dozier in the planning department, i understand where it came from, but it was a limitation as well.",30,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
no any other like government institution?,"so, i think, covid opened up minds, a lot on the importance of lab, and gave it very good attention. i think a lot of times it's taken for granted. whether it's the covid process, help to improve the general lab services i cannot answer with certainty.i cannot say that a lot of efforts were diverted towards handling the situation. so, i don't know if that was a plus or minus. i'm, i can say that the lessons that were learned. if they were if they are implemented is awakening strength of the system. so, lessons around you know the use of it based on technology, sms services.",31,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
"so yeah, and do you have for example this one was around laboratory diagnostics. so what about the health facilities should they be also involved in developing the ppp","okay.i think i've mentioned some but i'll try and see if i can pick up some other ones. i know there was this big project to build a national lab. so, i think, i think the fact that was being done in a silo. and it was a very big investment, i think that was a sticky point. i think there were projects going on but in silos. and i think we were not able to show that this piece of work connects, everybody. so, i don't think all the stakeholders were brought together on the table. i think, for ppp like this. and i keep comparing it with oxygen, because oxygen is smaller. oxygen had its really use the psa plants in rwanda, mainly at public facilities. you have only two or three private providers but labs is very different.",32,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
"but then, when we look at these key stakeholders. what is their influence in driving the ppp?","i don't know full visibility, i think the only teams that i really do know whether the government, because those are the teams that i work with, but i know that for example cdc has a lot of investments in labs. i didn't see them fully you know brought on board the abbott had a lot of, you know, investments there. and i think in the beginning, don't put but as things moved on, i didn't see them on board. i don't know who the main thing is i have the lab space in rwanda, but just off the top of my head, those are the ones that i felt were really instrumental that are not pulled in.",33,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
"the process, because we are still at this phase of the process. so especially when they are designing the ppp and when it comes to negotiations.","i think the ppp would have been submitted to rdb, but it needed to be approved by rbc. i know it's a bit complex but i think, unless rbc approved it, and was fully on board, it wouldn't fly",34,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
"and what about rdb you didn't list, actually it's now, rdb before the key stakeholders, when you're developing the ppp shouldn't rdb be there?","i didnâ€™t know if they didn't approve, i think they kind of just said, wait, you know, just hold on a little bit. for some of the reforms we're trying to implement, to see whether it will achieve certain results, then we can build on the ppp based on that. so, i don't think they said no, i think that's what happened and again for them it was really the financing, where's the money going to come from.",35,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
"and doing now, contract negotiation. what is your role?","i think there were options of that thing with instead of the full model to start with small pieces of the model, i remember the first one being the transportation optimal transportation. another option was to start with a few places and not the entire country and i think that also was a big, back and forth, because to achieve the full optimum optimization, doing it in a few districts would not achieve the kind of savings that the ppp model could potentially have. so those are the ways that i thought the model was being considered there was the broader picture with the full component or small-scale stuff with transportation improve that and then build it from there. and also, the option of starting a few districts then scale it up, but some colleagues were not very keen on geographical. you know, starting with a few districts and piloting. i think there's also one school of thought that if you do something in rwanda reading the entire country, which also makes sense. so, i think those are the different model designs and some of the limitation.",36,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
"and then, so how based on your experience with other ppp how interested are private partners to participate in the ppp. for instance what are their incentives to participate, what are their drawbacks?","that's a tough question. i think when you look at the technical pieces, and where the pool. what the core goal is the bottom line. i think it's a great opportunity. i think they're very it's very complex. because the different pieces youâ€™ve stated, all play a big part in this. so, for example the diagnostics market. when you do a ppp like this, i'm trying to narrow down the market that you allow, you know, into the space and what basis do you did decide that in order to make it cheaper. you know that that's a complicated one because it's a free market and rwanda is a small market as well.",37,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
and then what are the drawbacks?,"yeah, that's a tough one. you know, i think, if i was to continue it, i would sit at the dg on the head of the head of rbc. i'll sit with them and, you know, figure out with them, how to bring everyone along. that's where i see the opportunities because rbc they are the one in charge of lab ultimately. so, if that's the leading rbc, you know, to understand, you know, to understand what they think are the winds, and then be able to develop the agenda. based on rbc as a need. and i'm not talking about individual personalities i'm talking about the institutional, you know, the institutions, because rwanda institutions are strong, it's not an individual thing.",38,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
there is no problem it's based on what you learned.,"i think they were approached by the way that the way that chai approached it i think this was our mistake. we approach them just for information on small pieces. i think there's a very strong and again i don't know all of them maybe when you interview them it was sam, sam can really tell you because i'm going to each one of them. but the way we approach them as we information, not to bring them along to build something bigger than the other group was. i don't know which, which is the usaid funded project that's working on lmis. i don't know if it's cut know. there's another, there's another institution that does a lot of work on supply chain as well. so, i think the problem was we went for information not okay let's do this thing together. and i can understand it but it's not chai place to do that. and so, i think that's where the broader bigger meetings would have been helpful with all the right people, but i don't have a full extensive list of the private entities that would be relevant. the other piece, i don't know how much fda would also clear all. but i think that's also a good opportunity. and now, the role that is it camerwa, who was doing the work of procurement, camerwa. yeah, i think coming off with some good information, and i think they have this institutional memory that would also help build that up and rssb for finance piece and minister of finance, like you said, so this was really a big thing, but i think we handled it as if it was a technical. yeah, and i think that was a challenge.",39,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
this is the last question for you. how the ppp could be designed to achieve scale up and sustainability.,"yeah, i think it was, and i think that's the advantage of the ppp or ahdp in rwanda because like i said in the beginning, you know, the 80% of this lab in public facilities, so it already. and in rwanda i think everyone lives within 20 minutes of the health facility or 30 minutes. so, i think in terms, and then you have the fact that it's paid by insurance. so, rwanda naturally is designed to ensure quality. so, this project actually was expanding services to those that need it the most and improving the quality of lab, care to them not the higher income can tell, but i think it would be addressing the lower the groups. so, with no question that was naturally designed into the rwanda design. yeah.",40,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
"and then for sustainability when we go for ppp we want something that will actually address the challenges the issues that we have in whatever systems we're working with, if someone wanted to get working on a ppp in whatever sector. so what would you advise especially for the sustainability component? what should we look at? ","so, i think, i think, availability and quality were the ones that were most efficiency. if it was, if it was implemented as a whole. i think those three pieces would be addressed. but i think the biggest push was quality. and in a very simple language i liked how the minister put it he said it's not enough for the test of the blood to be drawn, but you want the results to go quickly, back to the doctor, or the patient has a diagnostic very simple, but you know, very efficient, and call it as an example. so, i think it addressed a lot of that. i think what wasn't addressed was the affordability.",41,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
"so, this is the last one, but this is for you actually so if there is anything that you would like to add on what we have discussed.","let me see for positive and negative. so, i think negative was the cost and who's going to pay for it. when the analysis was done and it showed it to be more expensive. it just switched off everyone. so, i think not being able to really dig into that affected the discussion negatively. on the positive side. i think the opportunity to improve quality affected it on the positive side. and so, you could see that tug of war we want to stay because it's going to do a lot of good, but then another thing to pay for it and can we afford it. and i remember there was one time we were tasked to go back and look at the cost, again. but you see, i think we didn't have the answers because we're not in a room where finance could give information and you know the right people rssb who are this be and so on. so, i think that those are the two factors quality for positive and then affordability to the government, especially during covid it on the negative i'm not seeing where additional money would come from.",42,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
"thank you for your time. and we're very glad that you've been able to find some time to discuss with us. and this will help this evaluation, and it will be really helpful for us to understand better the ppp process and ppp implementation at the country level, that will help also this evaluation that we are doing for the ahdp project.","yeah, i think in but definitely i think in these conversations you have to make sure that incentives ireland. and so, in this scenario in this process. we didn't even take time to understand the incentives of some of the stakeholders, so if you don't understand the incentive, how can you align to the incentives. so, i think that that was quite a challenge, not understanding, i'd have to know i don't understand from the incentive of abbott you know, or i wouldn't understand fully cdc is incentive except that eventually the plan to transition. but if you understand their incentive. you can align to it, you know, the government could then have crafted out. you know some strategies to apply to it so i definitely think that that was a challenge. and then you don't know what conversations happen, independently because these are independent, stakeholders, so you don't know what perception they have. it would be interesting when you interview some of them to see what perceptions they had, and whether if they had more information or if they were part of designing and building this, it would have moved further because i think they could clearly have funded certain elements that we discussed it in such a peaceful manner. again, it was very complex it's a very complex agenda.",43,rwa-int-pe_2022_3_10
"so, wanted just to know what was your involvement in ppp process under ahdp program, in rwanda? i'm sure you know about that.","i think i would answer two things here. i think the financial instruments proposed by ahdp were inappropriate, they felt very risky.so, i think they should have been alternatives, a broader range of instruments, whereas here that range of instruments seemed very narrow, at least that was the perception that i had, i could be wrong.i think the work that was done under ahdp however, like i said, is not wasted because it really on earthed the opportunities, you know, not just the challenges, but what are the opportunities to improve. and even though the argument is made that you cannot just improve one piece. you have to improve all of it, for there to be progress i think it's opened up, you know, for those who've really internalized the main messages. i think it's really led to some of the workers, you know some of the reforms that that are being implemented i think the one around decentralization and transportation. i know that the lab team have started something on that or they were starting something that it's based on some of these findings, combined with the dno work as well. so, i think the opportunity, you know, a lot has been annette, the challenge of the lab. salaries as well you know that's been on earth as well. so, i think there are a lot of things that have been on earth now that can, you know, even without, you know without, without a project, you know government now has, you know, pieces that we can start working on and building on as well and if they do decide to go holistically, they have a starting point to build from.",1,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_14
"when this project started did it started before covid during or after covid was it started with former minister of health, or it was with current minister of health? ","okay i think the environment in rwanda is very positive. it's because of rdb and i think rdb is very open, they have very high caliber stuff that understand, you know, public private partnerships. i think the challenge would be that we don't have many examples in the health sector and the health sector can be quite is different because you're delivering healthcare. but every conversation that we had with rdb they were very open. they asked the questions that mattered, that as a health, you know, someone working in health.",2,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_14
back in 2019 or 2018?,"so, i didn't work with abbott and roche i don't know, i really don't know what happened there. and i can't, i can't speak to that. but i think the fact that they are those three, you know, it's good. i think it's i think you only fail forward. i think that's something rwanda does a lot of learns and fields for it, it tends not to repeat past mistakes so, but i think it'd be good to speak to them, or people who are aware of the issues and opportunities. but personally, i'm not, i'm not fully informed yeah.",3,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_14
"if you allow me to go to the next question on.what was the process of negotiation over ppp, on this one so we're looking at the negotiation process how the health facility was selected, and how did it start and from your knowledge. what is the status of today?","i can say that. i think it's been a journey. i want. if i give an answer to be very. what's the word statistic cross section of people? i think my answer would be very biased but if you look at the investments that the government has made. one thing that i will say is that lab diagnostics is really questioned whether it's worth investing in or not. that's one. and whenever there's a new opportunity to improve the diagnostics to, you know, do better test the better to, you know, something that can deliver more value for money. you know, it's really considered seriously so for me that's a big eye opener. i think it shows that it's a priority, and the fact that even rssb that you know the lab tariffs is very low.the fact that they say that for me shows that they really realized that without proper diagnostics, you can't treat people well you can't give people good quality of care, or you end up wasting money in the long run because then they'll come around again and again until the diagnostics is cut right.i don't understand the why the profiling lab. the lab cadres were changed. and i think that's a question that i didn't get answers to i realized that the lab team though particular people who kept raising that question and planning didn't want to answer it. so, i think there's a reason, and it sounds like a complex one of those where, you know, it's, you have to wait. which side to build on. so, i'm not sure why the cadre was changed, but i think that's an area that needs to be looked into because by the time it was brought up in a policy meeting, that means they had grievances below, and then then those are dealt with, you know, it may have repercussions in the future. but it's difficult for me to answer that",4,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_14
"wow. thank you so much, i can't believe it.in the reports that you give, were you also be able to as you said, covid has disrupted maybe also improved the lab systems.","i think if you, if you talk to someone. i think what i think you should break down the multilateral that institute institutions like, usaid and cdc to look at the projects, the actual projects that are working in this space. and i think there are also other donors. you know that are involved that don't necessarily sit in rwanda i know find this one example, find yeah. is it five years, and then there's another one called? so, there are a couple of instances, there a couple of private entities of donor company so they probably like, i know these because they were funding, some of chai work, cephid, i think is also another one stuff in the field also is an interesting.but they are those smaller organizations, they're not based in a country they do a lot of marketing, and they also shape. a lot of this as well so they may be helpful to get the private, you know, what's the private sector, for example, that we're referring to in this case and i think that's maybe, maybe the only got that, that i saw.we have private labs we have private document, but who would have ultimately done this work. and i think that's the gap that i think i don't know the answer, sorry but just some thinking aloud.",5,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_14
"interesting. i have a really many questions with responded already, but i'll just go get to one on. ","one thing i know about private sector is again for rwanda, the biggest market is the public sector. so, i think for me it feels like a win-win. i think the private sector, entry may be narrowed a little bit. if this works, so you won't just have anyone coming in anyhow. the us, the country will be forced to develop a process to show you know how entry for different diagnostics done. so, i think, i think it could benefit both, i think it's a win win. if unless you because rwanda is not the country that has that benefits from chaos. if you have a country like i won't mention that benefits from chaos, by streamlining it you're, you know, reducing the opportunities for corruption. so that's not the case here. so here in this case because you're streamlining things better, and also improving the diagnostic capabilities, it's a win for public sector, it's a win for private sector because then you know the know where the money's coming from how much is going to be invested and so on what equipment needs to happen. at what point new equipment will be sold who's trying to have the information as well, to, to support. and then, ultimately, i think the biggest benefactorsâ€™ patients. in this case, yeah. ultimately, they're the biggest manufacturers.",6,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_14
who has been involved in the initial design of the ppp? ,"the tough one. i think i'll give you the politically correct answer. i think the question of how do incentives align is a big one. and understanding what each groups incentive is important. i think in the case of rwanda. i think the countries selected were clearly countries where the government ownership. so, i think in parts, there was very little influence that any external player could have. because if you look at if you're here for example, very strong in country ownership, you know, deciding on how things will go whether it makes sense. and so it was difficult to influence.",7,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_14
who do think that was the ultimately responsible for approving the ppp design and the one you submitted?,"i said they're similar because they both have strong government ownership. yeah, and i think that that's a very positive thing. you can't just influence both governments they are in control of, you know the direction in which the country moves and i think that's also why ahdp in these two countries was important to start in these two countries, because these needs clear, you know, a government that can lead the process because it's so complex, and i think that that's what i was trying to bring out.they're not governments that can easily be swayed or influence.",8,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_14
"things did not move, the way it supposed to move?","so again, i don't know all the private entities. but the bottom line for private sector is, you know, what do i gain? what's my ultimately, they're not public sector that we know. so, in terms of their bank balance what will it look like at the end of this so, i think one thing that i was, you know, nervous about, and i mentioned briefly is what it depends on how much money private sector is going to make over what period of time compared to what they're what they're benefiting now. so, for example if it's just transportation and, you know, improving the transportation, a private player who's already doing logistics in rwanda, taking on a contract like that it's really big win for them and being able to compete for it, and all logistic companies being able to compete for that is a big win. rwanda may not attract a huge, you know, private logistics player. you know, that's not in country already for something like that because the profit margin may not be may not may not make sense for them to invest in at that point. so that's from the side of the, the logistics. however, if you move to equipment, you know, if it meant that there was going to be a particular change in. in, you know the equipment investment and the amount of money that's required to invest. you know that could be a whole different ballgame and depending on how the ppp terms of reference or fulfil rfp, is drawn out. you know, that's in itself could attract a different kind of caliber but different types of private entities, depending on because remember it has to be attractive for private sector as well. and i think that's the tricky balance between ppp for oxygen, it was very clear because, you know, you have an entity coming putting in a plant, managing it. so, it's aware of how much is going on how much is coming in, and it has the market because rssb already pays for oxygen. so, 80% of the oxygen forget so forth for oxygen it was so clear.",9,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_14
what options were or still being considered when designing the model?,"i think, the current it's mainly health insurance that's paying for diagnostics. and i think, like i mentioned before, whether we're whether the tariff is accurate or not is something that needs to be needs to be investigated further.i think the system also one of the advantages that this ppp was going to do was to help rssb improved on how it determines tariffs.",10,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_14
"how appropriate is the design of ahdp ppp to local context? do you think it was adopted context, and how disruptive is the ppp to the current system how much change will it require?","i think for me the thing that i hope they don't stop is the financing piece, figuring out. you know the true cost of some of the diagnostic tests and you know if you find information that shows that they've already started working on that do share, because then that negates my point completely, because we could have started on it somewhere in tariffs revisions. yeah.",11,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_14
"thatâ€™s really great thank you so let's also follow up on what you just said was, how would you recommend us processes to have in buying for all stakeholders, you know, if you try to read them into international funders or international players, then multilateral organization, bilateral? ",so i was involved in different meetings when the project was submitted together with rbc different divisions to the departments planning on the clinical services. so i participated actively in those meetings for trying to analyze the contents of the project together with chai.,12,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_14
"who other private companies international founders, that you approach that were interested in this work, or they were not approached at all.","i was involved in that proposal of engaging, trying to manage the current laboratory network under ppp. so, we had many different proposals where we can choose one or not but before i didn't know that it was ahdp, it's only the proposal of engaging the government of rwanda to manage the entire laboratory network across this facility.",13,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_14
how would the ppp design address key considerations to improve access of laboratory diagnostics if ppp is proposed? ,"if i may recall, we might choose statical the current status we are operating in, we might choose the sample transportation. so the one who can win that the ppp can take over our sample transportation network. the third one was the co-management. so we bring an operator who can work with the government to co-manage, the current laboratory network in entire country. and the last one was the privatization, private taking over all entire network and being managed by a private company, a private ngo, and they can invoice some services to be paid by patients. so those were the four models. if i remember very well.",14,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_14
"which consideration is best served by the current design, which considerations is current receiving the least attention in the current design?","yeah, the negotiation pass through different phases.thereâ€™s a business or a feasibility study on the desk, people trying to analyze that feasibility study, which can be submitted to subsequent institutions for analysis. if we take an example of abbot, abbott ppp agreement you have with the minister of health this feasibility study, the project went to the rdb. rdb has a peak committee. it's a committee chaired by ministry of finance with rdb and the contracting authority, which is the ministry of health trying to analyze, and they can embrace the project, which is further, submitted to the cabinet and for abbott the cabinet approved that the abbott and the government of rwanda can work together and do the feasibility study, during operation model or the government of rwanda can agree to abbott to work on together. and after the feasibility study was done, also proposing some models some deliberations, according to what have been done during the period abbott has taken over with the government of rwanda to run the laboratories in some hospitals.",15,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_14
what factors do you think changed the discussion around the ppp? ,"the project brought by chai because what i knew was chai approached the government of rwanda, especially the ministry of health it was if recall well maybe the second year of abbott, and already the feasibility study was done of abbott and were some discussions between abbott and government of rwandahow can we make collaborations athigher levels .",16,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_14
"how about the stakeholders as you said that the stakeholders were not all involved, do you think that also could be the reason of the changes?","there were many discussions and the pros and cons during discussions and what i can say, people were reluctant to take a way of choosing something, because, if you don't choose, you remain with statical the current status, but you remain either with three of choices, sample transportation, co-management and privatization and the issue is relying on changing the current status. of course, for me personally, i agree that there is some issues and some challenges. we have some bottoms during the management of laboratories across the hospitals, the stock outs of lab reagents, the payment, and the issue of access because some patients, cannot have access to some tests. ",17,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_14
if ahdp is providing technical support and facilitating financing for this ppp how the availability of this support affects the ppp design?,there are two issues. the first one someone cannot take decision because is lacking some information maybe someone who's explaining the project. there are some information lacking which is not providing any details to push to choose and take that decision.,18,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_14
"how supportive, the existing policy, legal and regulatory framework for ppps? how much resistance among policymakers will just be, we need to overcome to garner the necessary support, or how flexible is the ppp to changes in the government-to-government priorities.","the first one is people are not used to ppp i can't say it's an information entirely on the project. i can say even is government being involved in everything, even to purchase paracetamol to purchase thermometer even the small things, the government can be, supplemented by private companies doing private business, it can be supported by private companies in partnership with the government. and in your co-management. so the more people are not used with the ppp. and i saw personally, when i arrived here, i was very exposed to many ppp projects. and i, opened my mind to know what the guidelines are, how the benefit fees, how do you evaluate the value for money?",19,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_14
"what other recent early experiences of project have been there in country that can provide lessons for ahdp? like abbott or roche so, how do you see this you know from the early experience that you have?","what i know is chai, ministry of health basically clinical services and planning and rbc, the national lab, specifically bios and which is overseeing the national lab, but those are three. i know",20,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_14

"what are or could be the plans to support public sector financing in the future? which different source of funding that are expected, are they financing support sustainable?","for me, the co-management is very good. i can't think other model apart the four proposed in that project. but this the preferred one, the co-management is very good. because now you work together, you use the existing infrastructure. it's something, it's a house.it's the equipment. maybe you can add more, but co-management is very good. and i can ask the payment from the insurers and they give you what i owe to you as payment. so the co- management is can be very good it's the best. yeah",27,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_14
"thank you so much really, i like to ask if you have any question or anything else to add.","the all models need to pass through the same state, but the changes we have, we have two options. the first one is the ppp without the procurement, the ppp without procurement has some conditions, is it for national security? is it for national interest? is this company the only one in this sector or this services that some conditions in the ppp guideline, if that one is not meeting those conditions. so you go to the for procurement process, which passes through the two steps i mentioned earlier, the expression of interest. people are send you the interest you analyze and those selected,you ask them the proposalsyou firstthe one you recommendto rdb, the rdbthe peak that committee they ask you some questions and if they embrace that one they submit tothe cabinet for approval. if the cabinet approves, you make an argument those are similar steps for each model you can choose.",28,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_14
"enjoy the rest of the day and really appreciate your time, your thoughts around how we can improve, thank you so much","there are two things. the first one we have a good universal coverage, which is, based on community based health insurances but what we can know is the contribution from population is not too much. and their payment are not much there are not much to address even the cost may be of some services. so the reason why the services are highly subsidized the consultations, the acts and the procedures. so someone who can invest in laboratory. and it is according also the abbott, abbott concluded that any model that they propose cannot work. yeah. according to their feasibility study. so they dig deeper, see that, it is very difficult to get some profits in each model that they're proposing. ",29,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_14
the first question that we would like to ask is understanding your involvement in this ppp any involvement that you had in the design of african health diagnostic platform in rwanda,"i do recommend if you can, as i said, you can have people can be okay. and you can have people that are between but how can we make sure those people are hesitant. make a pilot can we make a pilot? and at then at the end of pilot, six months or one month one year we have a study which can show that model is working that model can be sustainable. that model has these challenges, a, b, c, d, but those challenges are minimal and can be addressed these ways. so that can be scientific and can assure everyone who can be hesitant to implement the, the project yeah. okay.",1,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"the next question would like to know are you familiar with this project the african health diagnostic platform in rwanda. are you are very familiar you been involved, as you said?","it's very difficult. some people are tend to say, can we take over the, can we give work networks to one individual? how secure we are if something went wrong will go wrong. so again, everything can be put into agreement. how do you assure everyone that you are on safe side and any challenges you can anticipate? so, again, for me, it comes again on table of analysis. you analyze the challenges you anticipate and you brainstorm, how can we address those challenges? how can mitigate those risks? on both sides, because even the company engaging in ppp can have many problems, exactly. to have many works coming here to support us, or have these issues. and we try to, to support them in one way or other. so this can be anticipated by both sites.",2,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
thank you so much. you said you had many proposals can you elaborate on that?,"it was done. and i remember the proposal piloting was brought on the table and the people said the government is no longer do the piloting. we do things. they automatically the high level offices are asking us don't pilot, because you must analyze and be sure i'm okay. you do things i'm not okay i can't do things. so it's again what can i say what is this project? is it on which level can i explain and explain to above level because above me, there is another level that level, there's another level. so, as technician, the head of department, maybe i cannot understand, i can have fear to take some decision, but we try to explain to the, my supervisors, my bosses, they explain the projects and they take over those risks. because many people are sharing this and take, if we do reforms, any reforms must have the consequences, of course, but we do reforms those consequences, those challenges, and we mitigate in this way. so that kind of proposal, i might say, i see try to involve the higher leadership. i know that there is one meeting chaired by the minister, but maybe one is not enough. cause the minister has many agenda. but that doesn't know what the fruit from the discussions and meetings is. how did you, where were you stuck? why are you stuck there? is it reasonable? so i try to think in that box.",3,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
thank you so much. i think we are going to come back to those as well. i was just going to ask,"as i say, the all four models of this ppp had pros and cons. if you look atthe sample transportation, for examplei try to imagine wheni was director general of the hospital, i have a moral pregnancy for example, i must do alffor mother every day or some days, according to the guidelines . but that alfa fetoprotein is not allowed at the level of district hospital. exactly. but you have sample transportation, you can, you can transport that blood or that sample from byumba hospital to ruhengeri hospital, which has a tariff and capacity and train or screen the personnel to those and to do testing of that alf and because we have a digital platform you analyze, and that patient can even pay through digital, through mobile and send the proof. i have paid on my mobile. these are proof and you send samples and they can even give you the results through the phone numbers. so you increase access to the services. you use the existing referral process. you don't disturb anything. and that poor people already who can be transferred to private or to the referral can get services without expensive costs, like traveling, the staying at the referral hospital.

"and how far was actually this one, this current proposal of ahdp. do you think ahdp came after abbott, or was it the result of the operations that as you said?","it can use also the existing standards because you have standards. what is the turnaround time, how the privacy of results. so already the standards in place for hospitals and also for laboratorythemselves incorporating the into agreement with the government rwanda the ministryof health, and also the follow up with the implementations of thosewhichincorporated those standards,can make sure that it is being done.",5,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"thank you so much, doctor. do you think there were any issues around the ppp design and if there were how those issues were resolved?","for me i can't say that covid, has affected much the health sector because it increases the workload. the maybe there are some days and others, but in terms of profitability and the usual services, it is not like the other private sector, which will close. we remember some service were closed recently during entire without working, butthe hospital were open and people, of course, people doesn't have money to pay, like they used to have. so i can't say that covid changed a lotin decision making and it can also a good open opportunity to up and cause the future pandemiccan come. we need pcr in many centers in the future because we see if this an epidemic and a pandemic, uh, it is very easy to have a pcr rather than rapid test, which passes through the process of approval and the approval even who pre-qualification, national qualification, but the pcr is very rapid and to be used very easy to be adapted during pandemic and the epidemic.",6,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
if we have to do this again what do you think people should really insist and consider so that the risks during the discussions are minimized. can you speak a little bit about the risk or elaborate a bit about the risk?,"this can change.but the issue is sustainability, of course, the model can be good but how sustainable it can be, how long, can we work together? and many people can look at the, the way of building the sustainability, for example you can bring the machine, which has a cost of nine 50 million, rwandan francs, hundred million rwandanfrancs,which can equal tothose subsidies you want to adopt. so there are many things people can look at and say how can we finance this in a sustainable way and to cover the, what we are thinking as good.",7,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"at the beginning you said there, were two issues, and there's a lack of information. where do you think that information is not well shared? ","it must. and they must even submit the excel sheet, analyzing the what iscalled capital expenditureand how doif it is capital expenditure, how do you have apex? so, the many expenditures that they put in tax and further subject to be analyzed by financial specialist in rdb and apex stand i can look at it, but they are capex and apex ",8,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"what do you think, who has been involved in the initial design of ppp especially looking into ahdp ppp?","as i said maybe issues were in ppp understanding, the ppp guidelines and the roles, what are benefits. so trying to engage that rdb to explain to the, to line ministry and the stuff, but to understand that the ppp guidelines and the benefits, also the ministry of finance. we with the many requests, we want those money, but they get money from the collection of taxes. exactly. if the business are not going well, you remain if a hospital, which you are not yet expanded or innovated. so the only way is someone who can come partner with the government and agree with the government can take some shoe, a money, but in over the years, not in one time. kind of a loan with very low interest over time.",9,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"did you have any involvement of a private partner, civil society involved in this initial? ","the legal tools and frameworks are there and the well designed and the even the structures. i remember i know even at rdb, cause they are custodian, they have a department which is dealing, with and give someone who's want to go into ppp, but if you work with the government and assign the agreementthey have another department, which called aftercare.so they have after aftercare, any problem and issues arising from aftercare, they are brought in and facilitate the discussions. i can give you an example these drones. ",10,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"i would like to ask, you know, how did the actors involved in the design process change between the initial design and the current situation?","before i was not involved at the, at, in referral hospital, i saw only the agreement and there could be the implementer. but here at the ministry, iâ€™m involved, not principally , but as also a member of ongoing discussions, discussing with abbott the challenges during implementation cause hospitals, which i implementing are under my coordination. so try to capture the issues from hospital and to correlate with those from abbott and to find some solutions. yeah.",11,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"how about do you have any, would you call anyone here as a champion for supporting ppp?","i think it's very good, because if you tell truly, what you are thinking of the partner private, and also they can tell you through they think of the improvements can be done. i think the trust is very good. and through discussions through the different meetings you are conducting can tell youa personal experience. we have a ppp with health post under what we call the ofh one family health under the, you have many meetings with them because, any issues rising, you must sit down and sort out. and, because in the ppp a there's a third party, there's a ppp, an operator. and also, someone who accompany and those who are using services and also a regulator, which can be maybe so, as ministry of health we must engage those two the company, which is engaged in ppp. and also those who are using those services from that company of course there are some issues, must be brought on and to discuss and sort out.",12,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"thank you so much. do you think there's any actor, you know, look at the institution, who would oppose, the ppp, especially if you refer to ahdp one?","yeah, the government priorities also, it includes engagingprivate sector. and i remember we submitted to rdb recently what we call private sector engagement. yeah. we, because we had many calls from private companies, uh, to know the interest from the ministry, what are interests, what areas can wefinance, but not privately but with your support withthe partnerships and the laboratory was among the key areas wewant to partnerwith the private companies in ppp . yeah.",13,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"so if you had a ppp, who do you think or who, or which institution would have been ultimately responsible for improving the ppp design?","the document itself cannot change anything, to bind the ministry of health and rdb. and they clarify without the many consultations, you have interest in cancer, you have interest in i laboratory. do you have interest in oxygen implants?so it speaks itself. the interest from the ministry but, it needs other subsequent tools and subsequent ways of increasing the awareness. like those training. you mentioned, many post things, and some people were thinking, can we make a position, even if can be temporarily to the ministry on private sector engagement? can you have a ppp honor at the ministry, can you have atleast someone who can come at the ministry knows who can facilitate me, who is custodian who can understandvery well from first page to last page of ppp guidelines and who knows even the interest from the ministry. so those are many suggestions, many suggest of course, needs the other institutions to be take over. and they agree if he can have someone, but it can facilitate, and he or she can have even an annual plan. it's only be not engaging with private sector, also awareness among policy makers, and awareness among users. but maybe its many ideas out that maybe can be make, make it real in the future. ",14,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"how do you think this project, when do you think that they use the rdb procedure or they first come to ministry and they haven't checked with rdb? what happens here for the ahdp?","rbc, moh in planning, i think they were involved. rbc the director of lab, chai we were planning with the former country director and she accepted as well i think others, i don't know their levels of involvement, bmc, boofmar, lancet. and, but the crucial are rbc and us and also chai.",15,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"what options were, or are still being considered when designing the model, this ahdp model?","incentives, monetary are not good. to make a friendly climate maybe is it a workshop? maybe people can understand have a time not bound with because i can, before the meetings were even the online and virtual you don't know the level of involvement at virtual meeting. true. are they focused? do they read are they prepared? did they know the content? so are they able to ask some questions? so those are kind of, if i try to be neutral and to put on another side. what can i do in future",16,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"so just quickly do you think for the co-management, we need different modalities, different design for example, contracting options will be, or regulatory consideration would be different.","i don't know. i don't think there is no one only the hesitance, because, you can think of, you can shake when you have some the administrative ministerial level, our aim is something can improve.some people,are not appreciatingthe services of laboratory if to we go to the appreciation level of rdb they are among services are not appreciated ambulance too, the services of laboratory drugs, accessibility. we know that level. and, and if we did that change last year with rms i mean ppd again, reform will be needed a different way to addressthe access to the test and laboratory. so maybe hospitals, are getting revenue i cannot lie i was the hospital manager. and you can buy at cost of x and you get five x five times and four times. for example, if i tell you, for example, for a hepatitis test, they have more, more profits, pregnancy test, they have profit more profits. may be, but this is my guess.",17,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
how do you think how appropriate is the design of ahdp ppp to the local context? ,maybe they can be hesitant yeah. because they get something from it.,18,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"so how would you recommend a process to have a very deep buying for key stakeholders? for example, what would you recommend to international funders? here? we are looking at someone like bmg, some station, like bmg for your investment bank.",i'm not aware of that.,19,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"you know, you just say piloting is one of them. what else do you think need to be considered? if we have another opportunity to do the ppp with lab services?","yeah. maybe at level of the ministers and all, but we were approached by chai try to explain the project. but we don't know about that. ",20,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"and you think that this was not well done, considering that, you know, understanding the old stakeholders mapping and understanding who bringing the table how do you see that should be done?","the private partners it's their spirit they want to do their things on their own maybe they see that our public sector is very risky, very difficult to take some investment. the payment process from rssb can take an average of 90 days right now. before it was 180 can i now wait for those days to be reimbursed. so, it could be those scenarios and those questions we may see, and they, of course, every time say, how can we get capital to inject in those ppp? and do we have some special treatment, like loan with reduced interest, do you have, the guarantee?",21,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"how would an ideal ppp design, accommodate the needs of priority population? what is the best ppp in this one?","yeah they have. you look at, maybe there are some people investing in big hospital are bringing many equipment, they have equipment, and someone can buy a city scan themselves. so they, they have heavy investment so it is very easy to be open. and they also we because of the friendly environment and the business model of the country we are seeing many foreign investors cannot even right to the rwandan investors. i think it comes something that can be even attract foreigners to invest in.",22,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
how would the ppp design address key considerations to improve access of laboratory diagnostics? ,"we only have lancet as someone who is specialize in laboratory, others are opening up the clinic, but also adopt the laboratory. and bmc also had that unique laboratory model, but added some clinical services there maybe laboratory can be interested as some something that is private model.",23,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
what factors do you think changed the discussion around the ppp? and how do you think separate question covid would or affect the decision on the ppp?,"grants are not sustainable.loans from bank is alwaysthe only guarantee, but the only fear is the interest rate, which is very high so i suggest maybe if it is a loan from bankbut with law interest it can attract private investors.",24,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"i was just going to ask for example, if ahdp is providing technical support and facilitating financing for these people, how would the availability of this support affect the ppp design? ","it's very difficult and kind of ppp if the government has the infrastructure, the buildingsthe equipment, and the much demands from other future investment from the government, building other hospitals,scale up the already services to l specialtyit can be done, but with many priorities we have, and other prioritiesput on hold , if you have someone who can sustain the lab it can be very good for us and look at the other areas to invest.",25,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
do you think that there's a way that you can do ppp without looking at the financial instruments or ppp must have financial instrument?,"my question is,did i contribute a lot, because beforei wanted to tell tunga that i will not contribute because i don't have enough information. i skipped some meetings cause of different reasons.",26,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
how would you recommend ahdp technical support being used to address any of the gaps that you said weaknesses in capacity among his stakeholders?,"my role in the ppp process, started i think one year ago during the covid pandemic, i think in 2020 may_ june when chai came to see the minister and then minister called me and the team we went there to the meeting and then the country director of chai introduced this platform or the process to the minister, so the minister tasked us to work on it. so what we did, it was, first of all we established the steering committee. with clear term of reference with all stakeholders which i will share with you. okay. we developed it together with chai but also colleague from rbc lab division so from there have been already some work ongoing by that time, there was issue of completing the data collection which we did. we supported them to give them the introduction letter. we give them those data through hmis opening data we have, there was a formal appointment by the minister to the steering committee and after the appointment, the initial meeting workshop of five days and ps was the chair of the senate committee. it was appointed chair of committee. so there have been the first workshop and our team was there. we worked with them there were different people from hospital, private sector, rdb, university of rwanda of course with enabel, usaid but those are partners. it was quite a very good team. composed of all stakeholders. ",27,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"how supportive is the existing policy legal or regulatory framework to ppps that we have? do you have a lot of resistance in the policy makers, or do we have different ways of overcoming those resistance? how flexible is the ppp to changes in the government priorities?","i think it was around 20, i'll give you the composition, but also i, can share with you the reports that they did, the workshop were in musanze. i think that was july they had a workshop and they discussed a lot that time, there was the brief that i get for the team, thosekind of confusion, people, some people say that you know, you are going to bring one private sectorto have a monopoly.it will not be possible how this is complementally to, what abbott and roche they're doing. i see, which was quite different because i think there was a kind of we had to explain, to make people understand why this, i mean, the contribution of this initiative the ongoing initiative, this initiative came not only not to remove other initiatives but it was quite of somehow see how we can get more, can be more efficient the way we manage our lab we liked the idea, that's why we even continued to push it. and at that time there was a big feasibility study that was shared. i mean, after that, there was input from the steering committee, there was initial reports, and then the steering committee discussion, they approved the document, the document was shared in august. ",28,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"and you talked about the abbott examples and you also talk about your experience as a, as a district hospital manager. so how were you involved in the past experience in the ppp? or even here as a in charge of quality head of department?","at that time, like june when started lab leadership was involved the current one and the previous. i remember even when we had the meeting preparing the steering committee workshop, the former leader of lab is the one who proposed to have sample transportation, which i liked sincerely speaking, personally liked that idea and proposed that let start with sample transportation. that's why we have problems rather than going for full management or ppps hospital. and we took that idea, even the committee that was discussed, even though the workshop it was quite of because it was a mixture of people some of them were what's the first time to be introduced to a, that's why they bring all those, you know, monopoly versus their discussion shifts you know, it's not good to have one person to manage your lab.

"and how trusting collaborative was the relationship, or is the relationship between the public and private sector in this one?","yes. immediately. technically we communicate not officially to chai. and i think also other meeting between the leadership of chai here with the country director of chai, she had introduction, this was a visit to minister after being appointed. i was there in the meeting and minister told them that the process has been put on hold for one year probably end of next year.",30,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
what has been any historic investment and interest from government in laboratory diagnostics?or do you think it's align with the government priorities?,"yeah. there are two things. they mentioned two things they mentioned the dno but also they mentioned another thing. they say that they're going to strengthen the regional labs, you see the blood ncbt the regional office they're going to strengthen those regional and maybe some need to be renovated, but put some lab tests mean working with the nearby hospital. there is no machine in the hospital to put in those ncbt office.",31,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"do you think there will befor example, as you submitted the document to rdb, do you think you need to improve or work onhow the health work related to those diagnostic systemwould be able to actually accommodate all the new improvement?

"so, this is the list of people that would like to, we are actually planning to interview do you think we miss any, we would like to see any important stakeholder in that show card","yeah, my personal view. not the minister so i'll be frank with you i don't think what will do in this in one year will make a difference to change this option of having the ppp for lab. i mean, for sample transportation, why it's because we know what we are doing and how we do things. so number one it's i think we need we should sit together and see, i mean, we probably that one year that we had agreed on, i mean, that has been decided if we could have a time to discuss what are the advantages and disadvantages cause i'm seeing it, that not helping so much, the people even though so but i understand because most of the time government fear to engage to the private.",33,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"thank you so much for those, do you think there will be an incentive to participate in the ppp you know, the ones that you suggest","i think we need to do a lot of advocacy to bring more leadership, european investment bank, you see european investment bank. they have already give us money for the lab with the ministry finance the loan has been signed. so if they found that rwanda is more engaging in more projects. i think they will also continue to invest and they're going to support us that's one of the things i leave it to leadership. the district hospital is a first contact of the patient if they found that they have proper sample transportation, the lab would be busy. so the big lab is going to be there. with a well and effective sample transportation and this really a good time to do it. we will keep on advocating to see if this can work, but also i'm seeing a lot of opportunity if the banks can offer loans to the low interest rate too.",34,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
that's correct. thank you so much doctor whose interests are hurt or helped by laboratory diagnostic happening in public versus the private sector,"moh, mof, private sector like cdc, enabel, usaid those were working for supporting project engagement and chai also was involved.",35,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30

"okay. i see. and, and that's where, or you think that there may be potential threatened to ppp or contracting arrangement because that's where the hospital gets.some support. ","laughingi will align this with the leadership you don't have champions leadership champions. so leadership is minister of health first. they was one pushing it, even though they put it on hold, but it's the ministry of health. yeah. the ministry i see. but on, i think on personal note at that time it was not perceived, it pushed by chai. yeah. but when the conversation, i mean, that was the beginning, but when the evolving, it was very clear we found that there was kind of the government want to do it you remember the discussion we had yeah.",37,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"the fear, again, for me the ignorance is very difficult. and maybe you can have fear because you doesn't understand the project and you don't want to take risk. and sometimes in any projects it's boundary the risks. yeah. and some people fearing to take risk, due to a lot of fear. ","no i won't say that, there is oppose instead i think it's a progressive understanding so it's people were not in the same level of understanding the project, maybe what we want to do. what are the benefits, but also looking ahead and see what are we losing? what are we gaining?",38,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"thank you so much. and we are almost there. so do, do you think there were any bmgf, chai and european investment bank? that influence level of ppp dynamics here in country?","i think for this one, as i mentioned earlier two options, we need to sit together and discuss and revisit the decision and those details i stated above.",39,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
and the negotiation between chai and any of these bmg and european investment bankthe government were not involved?,"i'm not a politician but i used to follow speeches or the leadership. so the, let's saythe perspective ofour leader will say every timeyou see that private sector is a key actor.so he always say that, you know, there is a huge cost of not taking the right decision at the right moment. it's a huge cost that let's say the issues that we have now, the issues now, probably not yet, you know, we are still it's, covid new variant. we're still busy, but out there, people need services in a compressive manner. i've done good and very well scaling up, you know, services actually, but all those things, but in time of timely service, and also to see citizen satisfaction rates to the health services is still very low, very low. the leadership supporting the private. the leadership want us to advance but the implementation doesn't go with it. that's what i was saying huge cost of not taking the right decision at right time but people still need services, the system still have problem, we donâ€™t have protocols and there is a problem of us not taking decision, what could hinder the implementation is us because we don't have the same level of understanding mode, technical level, what are the issue we are trying to solve? but legal environment is there and is supportive except the implementation.",40,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
thank you so much. so you said that private partner didn't really were not involved when you started the negotiation with chai. what will you anticipate as a main question from private partner?,"i recommend, i think probably it might not sound aligned with their vision but number one, iâ€™ll recommend them toinject money where they give funds to the partner which i think they should, because of maybe they are funding arrangementsthey're not maybe funding they don't funding for specific project which is somehow risky.give the money to the privates operator, which is somehow very risky because that area is not yet known or mean implemented in that country. i'll give you a similar example. you can send it very well. you see when bably came at that time, it was not clear and the digital health but because they found that government, they came in the sector of service provision. let's say, for example, even though it's quite new, digital health but because it was aligned with what the government wanted of course with covid. yeah covid come after, but cause the government want to promote the digital things investment it then through that government, the country vision.",41,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"okay. thank you so much. and you think, first of all, they have capacity, if this was an open option?","i thinkthat will be the role of the government when they're negotiating, especially the regulation of the price, the good thing the government has issued, the, the pricing policy, and now the ministry order to enforce that policy press policy. the government can regulate the prices on the market so that person will not suffer either paying or co-payment.",42,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"okay. do you have any idea of who could be the potential, a private partner in this say starting by the country?","no we don't have a specific issue but gender will be considered when it comes to prioritization. cause like nowwe have specific issue for women cervical and breast cancer those, i think some of the, those let's say for example, thoselab services, lab tests we should prioritized especially those thingsto make sure the services for women are well provided.",43,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"thank you so much. i know that we've been taking, almost one hour and 15 minutes.","on the financial side. i don't see, it's depend on the time of reference. that's find the private sector, the private operator,an example i can give for sample transportation,the private sector brings his own money. of course.the reason why, i mean, that's one is for him, but i think once the project, i think for, he it's always get because of that funds the liquidity for the private sector to inject or to start like startup capital. it was already cater in the product, but on our side i mean, i don't see any financial salary risk as far as i mean, the service are provided the only problem that i could anticipate fromthe insurance, but also for the insurance, there is a way you can avoid it. it depends the way you negotiate the tariff yeah. you can negotiate the tariff. and then the government, you know, with the insurance, make it low so people can access, the more you increase the tariff it's become more difficult for people to access, call the co-payment. but in general, i can't, i don't see any financial issue this the role of the government to regulate the cost. i think that could be one to anticipate some of the financial issue.",44,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"do you see any, any support in terms of coming from the government letâ€™s say, for example, we are seeing that the lab system are being improved. do you think the government has the room to inject more funds by itself?","i think this model is quite particular. that's what i suggest. i give you that example of sdg funding, because we have developed partners coming to engage in moh with two source of funding. philanthropy also fund from a central bank it's quite particular but what they can learn from you know, let's give you an example, not the specific area imentioned that one for the covidbecause the government provide over all leadership, the reporting, you know, all those things monitoring make sure that people are reporting their stock. people are getting results, you know, because they're very sensitive because see, i think that could be quite a similar.",45,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30
"that's really very interesting. and i think you said it work it's to expand on the existing, not government to start in new. yeah. that's what you kept on saying that ppp could be one, one way as, as many others learn and stuff. and thank you so much, dr. thank you. i really appreciate. and before would like to ask if you have any question for us,","the financial department from moh because. they were involved in the discussion too, enabel, rbc, chai, mof, king faisal should be included too the cfo of it, usaid,unfp should involve too and the ceo of psf should be included about labs bmc and lancet you should keep them , fdaand psa too.",46,rwa_int_pe_2021_11_30

"and starting, just would like to know how your involvement in the ppp process under this project is?","from the ppp process when started at that time, i wasn't yet in my position, but i read the report, but was obtained from what has been done so far. for my side, at that time, when i came in, i had to look into the report, what is the report? and what are the national strategies that are putting into place to improve? the quality of service delivered, advice as technical part of the technical team. so we looked into the national strategies as far as the lab is concerned that are put into place to improve the service. and look as well into the recommendations from the ppp and advice whether we proceed with the ppp or if we go for the national strategy or strategy is put into place and see whether we can proceed with the ppp when the time comes. so we looked into the strategies that are put into place at that time and yes we looked into what the ppp was to offer. and yes we advise that for the ppp we should wait for a moment for the strategies put into place to be implemented and see what the outcome from the strategies are? and therefore looking to the ppps proposing and from there, you know, which type of ppp you can prefer.",1,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
"oh, wow. steering committee how many people in the steering committee? ","yes those are the two strategies, actually certain from the molecular testing, but also expanding to other tests.",2,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
what was the process of negotiation over ppp how did the process vary by topic?,"apart from the central level where we are for the moment we look at into having four others meaning four, one into each and every province. okay. so there will be a collision of regional offices of rbc, but there will be at provincial level at each province we will be having one office.",3,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
and that was communicated to chai that will hold on for one year? ,"it is going to be hard to tell cause i was not in there at that time but when we were discussing in a way this can happen we were seeing, do let start stepwise starting with let's say, different levels of health system starting from let's say a referral level district level health center level, even post health, post level and select in each and every province, a sample that will be representative of the whole country. ",4,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
thank you so much. and this process was put in hold because of there was a dno that was put in place to support?,"it was really a discussion which was open but we were thinking about, actually that was the first one was that one, that one was, was that way. but the other thing was why can't we start with a simple transportation ppp and see how it's changed. and if we realize that by allowing samples to move from the lowest level to the highest level easily is increasing maybe the volumes. and if it's increasing the volumes, that simply will tell us that now we will, we need more of space for the lab. more of the equipment for the lab, more has to be done, and so on to cover the volume, which is increasing. so that's, when we were thinking that now we will move to the, to another step where we, we say that now let's move to the lab management, ppp, where we bring in a, but a private partner to, to equip if need be the lab in terms of equipmentâ€™s, themselves, or technical staff to cover the gap, which is increasingly to the increasing volumes of samples and so on.",5,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
"oh, really?why? ","actually it implies that actually this comes actually as one of the most, top priorities of rbc, which is actually the centralizing the test from central level to, to at least provincial levels. so they can create of space at central level for special tests and even research. so this is going to depend again, on the needs of a given religion, you can say, for example, in the northern province where we already know that diseases, which are highly infectious, such as ebola among of the diseases come from uganda and congo. so the center that's going to be built there, it'll be having a vhf lab viral hemo, fevers lab, specific and specialized for that among other tests, while in other regions, they can focus more on, bacteriology let's say, so it'll depend again on the needs of a specific region and what we have seen as issues and that specific region. so we will decentralize all those tests in that way, so that the tests we moving from of those different regions to the central level actually be run to those into those labs instead of being brought into the central level. so this actually what it implies, and this is the main purpose for rbc.",6,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
"what do you think were the issues to implement the design, the ppp design to be designed and how, how these issues were discussed and resolved? ","no, we have decentralized all of those services regarding the quality monitoring and all those, the mentorship, the training at that level.so that if a fridge is not working in nyagatare, then people don't start calling the central level, but they will start calling a central to be, for example, at rwamagana that they have a problem in nyagatare. so that will be easier to respond to. and also give that space that we need at central to focus on more important things.",7,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
what do you think would be done to solve those issues for the government to engage?,"when i came in the ppp, work actually was done at that time. there was a report out that we had to discuss. i remember that many people couldn't really understand what the ppp all about. i remember that i was given a report, which was, which was quite big, and i had to read even myself to understand. so there are quite number of people who were not really understanding what it all about, and they were expect thing actually, myself, to be able to understand. and, the other time i had to learn everything, i had to ask so many questions, at least i was from the lab. it was easy for me to get, yes, i can say that people, many people were hesitating, and to making decision regarding the ppp one, i think it was, a lack of information, which was actually information, which were not actually for me enough for people to grasp. what is the, the main idea for the ppp?secondly, there was that lack of information, but there is also a lack of people, i think, who are there before maybe to and who understood well, what the people was about to clarify, what is all about, and being there in that position where i have to really understand what it's all about, and again, go back. and what are the strategies that we are putting into place?",8,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
thank you so much dr. who do you think has been involved in the initial design of the ppp? ,"implementing them. yes. i remember, i think it was in january 2021 when we started the with the dno and at that time, i don't think i knew even about the ppp yes, the first time i ate, came to my knowledge yes, we were in a meeting and they called me and they told me, do you know this, the lab management ppp? i said, no, i don't know about it. they give me a quite huge report to go and read about and, yes, that's how it came to my knowledge. but yes, that was like, like in april or something. okay. and we had already started implementing other strategies.",9,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
and how about civil society? did the civil society involved?,"no, actually i started my position in december last year and i think that work, was accomplished before. okay. and the time i started the report was in out yes.",10,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
i would like just to ask one quick question do you think we had champions for ppp for this ahdp? who are these champions,"i'm not sure. i don't have all the information but i think yes, i think the national reference lab at that level was involved, but i'm not sure i'm not sure who and who were involved, but i think as far as lab is involved, i think, maybe at different levels that i'm not sure of, but i think the lab had to be involved at that time. who knows maybe even the department, but i realized that people had more information were at the level of the ministry, the ministry. yes. and they were the one with the report. they are the one who are following that, the ppp.",11,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
and how about do you have any actor trying to oppose it though the ppp on ahdp? ,"i think chai was involved as well in the ppp i'm not sure, but about other partners, i'm not sure having the information.",12,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
"what options were, or still being considered when designing the model? ","i think that will be the ministry to endorse the ppp for us we can maybe recommend us technical team, whether this is going to help us. it's not going to help, or this can be improved to make it more efficient.",13,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
do you think how appropriate is the design of ahdp ppp to local context? ,"i do not remember all the options no, but there is the lab co-management ppp, if i remember very well, the simple transportation ppp i don't really remember. i think there were three.",14,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
what would you recommend as a processes to have a buy in all the key stakeholders?how about international funders? multilateral/ bilateral organization? ,"i think they have to fit. i think it's not optional, i think they have to fit into the regulations and as far as, the options that, where they were proposed, i think they were fitting into the regulations and norms. that the only challenge i think, was not about the norms far as we see that it makes an impact. the norms were actually okay with the ppp and the regulations.",15,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
how would an ideal ppp specially this ahdp ppp design assure the needs of priority populations?,"i think this is a new framework, it's a new framework that was actually to be explored and this is actually one of the things that brought in actually that hesitancy people are not used to have the public institution, partnering with the private, but i believe that yes, the private sector has something to offer, to bring to the public institutions that is worth to explore.",16,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
"how has gender influenced the design of the ppp? like male and female, do we have any problem there in terms of access of the services when it's come to ppp?","yeah. i think a better approach is for it to be implemented is to first of all know what are the gaps that are in the public sector and highlight what is the ppp bringing to fill up the gaps? so if these approach is well elaborated, so the ppp will be appropriate. i think the ppp, needs to be flexible to the needs, the actual needs of the system. this is the only way to make it appropriate. and i think bringing in a private partner will depend on those spaces that we can see into the system where the private will come and fit in.",17,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
"some of the things i discussed, any idea on the financial risk. what are the factors do you think, change the discussion around the ppp?","yes.i can take an example when, we were reading through the lab co-management ppp.so it wasn't clear enough, at which extent it goes and the question were, the government has done this so far. are we going to put all of this into the hands of the private partner and, how is going to, yes, we have all the equipment. so all the infrastructures, if we put them in the hands of a private, will it be appropriate or what will be now, that partnership be looking like, what is the efforts so far done by the, by the government to deliverthe services at that table will be, will be considered. so there were so many questions around, because i think it wasn't clear enough at which extent and how this is going to be implemented. so there were so many questions around that actually.we're not clear enough. and therefore, the hesitancy of course.",18,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
"i see, thank you so much. i'm just going a little before. i know your time. um, some of the questions responded while you respond to others. ","i think, actually all the stakeholders we need to sit down and see what is the current situation? what are the gaps?what is the contribution and their stakeholder fill up the gap and what can be a better approach to move on. and this needs to not only the management of the lab, not only the management of, or even nature of health, but everyone who's involved.",19,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
looking at this list who are the key stakeholders in the ppp that were involved that we are missing?,"lab, like we, we can say let's say starting from the management of the lab, going up to the management of biomedical services department,the management rbcitself, the clinical service department in ministry health, and even people representing the ministry level,should be involved. and they, they will be also because it's an investment kind of thing they also have to berdb in this, because they will need to, to also make a decision, whether there is that investor coming in or this investment that is to be happening. and they will be yes, other partners, you can say cdc, who, chai, usaid.yes, all those partners that we work with, in our daily basis to improve the quality of service in the network, they need to sit down and see what has been done. uh, what is the current situation? what is a better way to move forward? ",20,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
"what could be the plans in place to support public sector financing of diagnostics? for example, if it's a lab, how much do you think will be needed to have, uh, a general seek treatment center? ","yes the first recommendation is, you remember when i, i say that i, it came to my knowledge when i was having meeting at the ministry. i think a better approach is to start with those implementers who are actually us get the management of the lab involved, get the lab involved and is actually being proposed. those are the ones actually trying to implement all the strategies that maybe even the policies for coming from the ministry. so getting them involved makes, they collected information even more accurate and even easily understood and implemented later alone. so starting for that low level, actually, i believe that makes all the times when it comes to implementation the work even easier. because i remember i'm seeing this. because when i go the report, i come and present it to the directors, no one knew about the ppp and the directors in the different units.",21,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_2
"so the first question that i have for you is actually, i want you to describe your involvement in the ahdp initiative here in rwanda","when i look into the health system and or even service delivery, all i think is ideal is to increase the access of, of services by decentralizing the services to the lowest level possible. so the best ppp should actually act in that direction where we have the populationdown there, able to access the and best on the services, the bigger, the package of tests possible to the lowest level, instead ofall the time, getting a and say these tests are not, we are not able to do them. you need to go to another level, see most of patients will lose, will lose them in that way of referring them. and later on, we get them very sick and even not able to even put them anymore, why it was preventable if that this were done down there even before the case, wasn't so decentralizing and increasing the access of services, it's all priority and it's key to the quality of services.",1,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"so if i have well understood you talked about national strategies and those strategies the first one, you said the decentralization of your lab offices. yes. as well as diagnostic network optimization","i think we will need again, to rework on the ppp even the proposals or different options of what the ppp are, because it wasn't clear for me, including me so it was really hard to tell, how this is going to benefit the population. it wasn't really easy to integrate into the existing system due to that limited, i think, understanding of the report itself or the ppps as a whole.this comes in again the involvement of the implementers, those who are supposed to implement the technical people who are supposed actually to support the ppp if they support. so it's hard really to tell when you, it's not very clear.",2,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"yes. so in this decentralization, how many offices are you planning all over the country?","i think okay. i don't have the model that we recommended with me but i think the best model should actually, be fitting with the priorities, the strategies that we are talking about, if we are talking about let's say, talking about with the priorities to centralize the test, uh, even if it involved, for example, to place it, the poc point of care machines, let's say the ppp should come in as yes. as a yes. is a private partner, but responding to the, the needs highlighted. so if we are now talking about decentralizing, those tests, centralizing these labs, the ppp should actually go into that direction. these are the key consideration. ",3,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"okay. thank you i've understood that you were not necessarily there during the negotiation, but based on the informationâ€™s that you maybe got from the person who was there before you.","yes okay. so that's why i said maybe we will need to rework on the proposal and the combination of the ppp to make sure that it's actually, they are updated to the actual gaps now that are existing. okay. not repeating or duplicating what is being done but also to see what is done, what is not, covered yeah. with the efforts, put into place and start filling the gaps with the ppp.",4,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
what was the model that you wanted to implement? at that time the one that was selected,"again, it's going to be hard for me to answer cause i was not there for the discussion that were done before, but there was that limited level of involvement and therefore understanding or the ppp the level implementers it was like something that was done when i came in and something that was understood by at the high level, but the lowest level wasn't to be involved enough. so this is one, two is, when we looked into the ways going to be implemented, starting from the part that is not, clear for us, what's meant to impact on even if the, the access, the quality among the affordability, those pillars of good service were clear, were very clear, but it wasn't, um, it wasn't clear enough for the implementers, how it's going to be done. and, and if we are engaging the partners to invest in our health sector to improve the health, , service delivery, we couldn't really understand how the ppp and the equals of the government and the partners are going tomarry each other to make, this service delivery improved.i think, there was that clarity of information, which was not actually good enough to, to clear the point that were raised.",5,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
so i would like to come back to these national strategies to better understand them what does it imply when you are decentralizing? ,"a lab actually has let's say three big department, let's say they are human resources, there is infrastructures, there is finance too to make that actually everything operates. so the staff that we have currently starting from the staff are people who are on structure, the structure of marital structure. and there are those that are brought by the projects want structure. so we were saying if the private partner comes in is going to take over the staff and everything, and there was no answer to that. for example, the equipmentâ€™s that are existing, if theprivate partner comes in, is the partner going to hire the equipmentâ€™s and buy the reagent for the equipmentâ€™s and run the services, maybe pay the government or the government, pay the partner. so they were those many questions that i think were not clear enough and touching all the, all the aspects of the lab, going to the procurement, even itself.we know the procurement how it is done all the channels that we all followed regulations and all of that, if we bring in the private partner, how is going to change, how is going to be impacted. so, i think all those levels, when it comes to information, they were not actually well elaborated, and there were so many questions that were remaining unanswered.",6,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"are you also going to decentralize everything that is related to monitoring and evaluation assessment of quality, or are those functions going to stay with the central level?","we had to like two or three meetings at the ministry. and all those questions that i'm asking were asked by many other people, and they remained not satisfied with the what actually the answers. i think this comes actually, i'm not blaming the high level, but i believe that as not being the technical people, even the level of embracing or understanding where, how this is going to be happening is it can also be challenging for them. but when it comes to these people at the lowest level who are on the field, who understand the needs, who understand the gaps. it's very easy for them to highlight the point to propose solutions to the issues that they're facing, but was coming from up to down. what i believe should go down to up. so when it comes to, from up to down, could not understand it's difficult for them to even embrace and implement.",7,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"so going back to the ahdp negotiation process, were there any sticking points, where it was difficult to reach an agreement when you were discussing this ppp model.","it'll depend again, on when we talk about financing, what actually, which one is going to be financed. and at which extent the finance can come in and say, i'm supporting half of staff. let's say half of staff, to improve the, to improve the system, but yes, this can be a support maybe, but not solving the problem. yeah. so it depends on actually how the financing is going to be even flexible to the needs even. specifically to be flexible to the needs.",8,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
so when did you start implementing these national strategies?,"my knowledge of private and laws and i'm not, i don't have all the information, getting the laws that govern the ppp as more of technical societies from the lab , butit's going to be able to answer to the question,but i think the people from, the legal office can answer the best to the question, the office of the lab. we don't have a legal office. yes. we have a legal, legal office.who can say, okay, we have these laws and laws who govern the, the private partners who are coming in. so yes, they can go into that much bigger than i.",9,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
so meaning you were not there during the ppp negotiation and when they were at the design and coming up with different options?,"yes. you have had abbott as a ppp and a report that was released by, was it a third party in maybe supported by chai i think the report that was out the feasibility report was proposing three different options and those three different options the government was losing.this was from the beginning, a ppp that was implemented very fast. and, and when we evaluated during the feasibility to study, we realized that the three options that we were offering, they were saying, if you are given the reagent for free , the government will be losing. if we continue, if we buy the, if we, we give you the reagent for free, you reduce the staff of lab by half, the government will still lose. the third was, if we give you the reagent for free, we reduce the staff by half, and you consolidate we create a new network. they were talking about any of thosestill the government lose, meaning that in any of the options that you choose you lose. so you ask yourself, why am i in the ppp?",10,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"so who were the institutions, what institutions or people persons were involved in this design negotiation?","again, i donâ€™t have all the details, but what i have as details that they had to place the equipment and run, the tests and the government, the procurement would be buying. it was a placement kind of contract, and the government would be buying everything. and later on, when they,they havethe feasibility study shows that, uh, this placement, this way of working with the government by procuring everything for the government works, they will even build what they have called a center of excellence and all of that. it was a, quite a huge project. i don't know how before the negotiations were, or when they started the implementation, what was the, what were the ground rule?but yes, it was revealed that it's not working. okay. it's not really working. so this was not a very good experience with that ppp.",11,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
what about partners?,"i think there's no issue with the trust. actually only issue would be what are you bringing on the table which is going to improve. that's actually the main, um, the main issue cause have been working with the partners. we have bably which is operational and giving services to rwandans and highly appreciated them. so there's no issue with the trust. the issue is what are you bringing to fill up what we can see as a gap we can set a gap where we can, we have been approach by different partners. and there is another one, another private, company who, who is actually tried to present, some of proposals or solutions. and they call themselves lab at home, for us. it's very interesting. because these people are to be reaching people to where they are. for example, i'm here in my office and i'm diabetic, let's say, and i all the time, let's say do my blood.",12,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
what is the institution that is ultimately responsible for approving ppp project?,"one of the priorities of our sector is to increase the accessibility. as i said, of services to the population down there, the national strategies, for the lab as well, go in those directions as they're highlighted by the priorities of health sector, therefore, as i said, we are looking at how can we increase the primary health care access to those people? so that's whenat the level of the lab, we are thinking about decentralizing, the test we are thinking about using the point care machines we are thinking about increasing the packages of tests to health centers and health posts. we are thinking about increasing, the accessibility of our digital systems to those lowest level so that they can, we can be able to collect even information and the to feed in our systems, the data that will help us to even monitor and even improve those services that are actually provided in those different levels. this is the one example that i'm taking to show how actually we also align with the priorities of health sector among many that exist.",13,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
so the first question is looking at the options that were considered during the design of the ppp what are these options?,"we have the level of a2those who did the lab long back in the secondary school, and they have a two, we have those who are, again, upgraded to the level a1. and we have those who have the level a0, which is a bachelor's degree. and i think on the structure, i think we do not have, the levels of, of masters to the, in the labs. i think it's up to the bachelor's degree. maybe lab comes in when it comes to management. and these people have trainings in general laboratory sciences.",14,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
so this model do you think that they deviate from any regulatory norms or they can't fit into the norms that we have in the country?,"starting from the ministry and rbc these are key stakeholders that have to be there. because they're the key implementers. they're the one coming up with the priorities and policies for health sector for the gor institutions, including ministry of finance and planning is important because we talked about in the financial aspect of the ppp. so it's important to bring them in to ensure that this part is also elaborated and we will be able to get what we expect from it, the rdb is important because it's the rdb is in charge of the investors who are coming in the country. so all the decision that involve, an investor already be easier, the time he is involved the procurement agency cause of the procurement aspect of it, and is also to be there.",15,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"so do you think that option of co-management, does it fit into the norms that we have, the regulations that we have framework that we have, and there is nothing that can go against that?","i'm not them, but i'm going to try to put my feet in their shoes, i think each and everyone wants, starting with the public, going back to the private, facilities that we work with. and again, looking into the role of the partners as cdc among these, all of these actually should actually embrace see how the highlighted gaps to be paid by the ptp is actually approach. and having the stakeholders like the bridge, or they can say, okay, we have these gaps, we are able to fill in these gaps, cdc. we are able to fill in these gaps and so on and there remain gaps. so the ppp maybe let says, start with the financial aspect of it. if we had to take a loan, it has taken a loan that we fill up this gap, because we're not able to fill this gap.",16,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"so if you look at the design that were discussed and the one that was maybe recommended, how is it appropriate to the local context?","for me, i have never been afraid of the turnover, because all the time i tell people, i train this staff in the lab, for example, to do this test. if she moves to another lab, i'm not losing. cause she's serving another one on the other side and yet the trainings are not worse in a time. it's a continuous thing. so i haven't, seen anything like a threat, or a turnover itself as a threat. yeah.you know, because the person is moving it's from one institution to another and if he's not serving here he's serving there is a gap he's feeling and the training that i have planned its continuous, even if there's someone new, the person will be trainedimmediately directly through trainings or would be mentorship of the colleagues",17,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"you read the report, actually, maybe you were not being part of all these discussions, do you see anywhere a place where this was not going to work?the way the options were framed, maybe there is a place where maybe it was going to be difficult to implement that. ","the turnover to the ppp process.i think the ppp, as you said, is going to be a process to implement it and the turnover you can't stop it in any way. there will be a turnover. yeah. for that to be a threat to the ppp. i think, i don't think that can be a threat, i don't think because the ppp is an approach, which is a system based and when something, when an approach is a system based, it can be easily disrupted by a turnover unless if the system changes the directions",18,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"do you think that when discussing about ppp, what are the stakeholders that should sit around the table to come up with a good ppp model?","the system change here. i mean the shift in priorities. that can impact on the ppp, if the direction is clear and people have embraced the approach, the ppp, i think turnover shouldn't be a threat.but i think it should actually, as i said, feel as also that as an opportunity it should appear to the ppp as an opportunity, again to fill up the gaps, which are existing. and i said, if someone moved to another place, they have someone new, you are training and transferring skills to a new person but the first is not lost. he's still operating in the network. so he's filling a gap in one way or the other.",19,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"can you list these people that you're saying, okay, institutions, when you say everyone, especially in, in the lab sector?","that's a good question, but i'm not able to answer because ,i'm not part of the private sector, but i thinkeach and every partner private sector from the private sector, um, yes, they can feel really,attracted by the publicby the issues, with the public. is that compared to the private, private, actually it's manageable. it's very flexible, but when it comes to, to public is well regulated and rigid. so, uh, marrying the two actually requires the private to be flexible enough to, to fit in the public.",20,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"what would be your recommendations, in a way of improving how the process was undertaken?","i think actually everything actually reside around this, around this and if this, so the privates were regulated, were structured and most of the time, you know, with the private, they want to move very fast and they find their flexible ways, which is not all the time, the kids for the public and for them, they perceive the public as delaying them in their race. ",21,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
how would an ideal ppp design accommodate the needs of priority populations in rwanda?,"i think i can say the existing gaps, there are gaps that we all know being in public for being in private and those gaps yes, and they attract the private sector, they attract the public sector and if they manage actually to work through the process to fill up the gaps, actually yes, they make also their interests into that. yes. we have had examples. we have bably i talked about, there's another one that i'm talking, which is lab at home which has a very innovative idea. i think as lab we have embrace and we really even encourage them to present to them, to, to present the idea to the ministry. yes, by looking to the gaps, some are interested with innovative ideas and they just died in there.",22,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"so now when you look at the final proposal we have for the ahdp and then compared to the ideal one that you are thinking of where are the differences, where are the gaps that we have with?","i'm not sure but i think they are. when i look at what are the services that we offer different labels and what are the volumes and what are people outside there in terms of volumes who needs the services and how frequentthey go to the private, i think they can be, some privatepartners that can actually but when i look at for example, bmc, which does those special tests maybe that we aren't able to do for the momentand what was proposed in the model the model was actually building that kind capacity that we not have, so that we deliver everything that we have we need to deliver. but bmc is a lab, which is separate operating as a private lab to which we may refer. it is so would you yes. it's yes, they can, they can contribute at the, at a given level.may be not at the level that we may wish them to, to contribute, but i think yes, to the certain level.",23,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
how will the ppp design address key considerations to improve access of lab diagnostic?,"i'm looking into this, how this can be done. we have loans the government, uh, that is going to inject in the private labs to make sure that they provide the service to the population that the government is trying to make sure that it is covered by public, so that for the private, they can do it, they can do it. but the challenge with the public is all times with the tariffs and how they're covered by theto protect them to down there so they can do it, but the issue remains, are we at the level of the primary care to them to down there to the population arewegiving him access to all the tests? they can maybe build infrastructures, equip them the state of arts technology, but if the tariffs very high and not covered by the rssb, they not receive the service. so i'm looking into the way of how it keeps working with the government who understands the quality of the services to the population and who is able to mobilize the funds to make sure that tariff goes down increasing the access of the service. that's actually, how i look at it, even if i know that those private companies can do it but now the question is, okay how is it accessible? how is it affordable to down there as actually comes in as an issue?",24,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"so if i understood, well, what you are saying is that i actually, this design was addressing a consideration that you had already started working on through the national strategies. ","the plans to ensure that the private sector services are sustained financially. this is actually, i think i raise the same question when i was discussing about how now, the sustainability of the ppp it was a question that we all, even ourselves i'm surprised that you also ask a question. because we were thinking, we are saying, okay, we have a private partner coming into partner with the public. if there is a long sustaining or making the things run when the loan will be withdrawn, is the government able to sustain the private partner? to be sure that the good service that we have seen delivered is sustained. so there was that aspect, i think that was not maybe elaborated well in the report that will also ask ourselves in any way, the government will invest.",25,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
what are the factors that change the discussion around the ahdp ppp?,"there is government but also partners, which is different.when we talk about the private sector because we are not yet to the level that we say we are done with the public facilities. it has now strengthened by financing, the private sector. we are not at that level. yes, because we are working, we are still improving that was my question for the public sector, because we're looking mainly for the public sector, public sector. so how is it going to be finance it's mainly through government and yes. and private partners.",26,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"what are the type of information that you wanted to be more sure? what are the missing informationâ€™s that you would like to have to, to understand better?","i can't say that we are at the level of sustaining everything without any partner first of all, because all the times we are still building the health system and we need to work with partners cause of different reasons, to improve and also to be able to benchmark what we havewith other exposures through the partners so yes, we are not able to, we, we are not yet at the level of say that we can self-sustain. we still need the partner to work with the partners and the aim for each and everything that we do when we come up with these strategies of generating income is to see how we can move forward to that level of sustainability. but i can say that we answer it there. there's still a lot to work on to make sure that actually we reach that state.",27,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
did you get the chance to ask those questions in maybe any meetings or forum to get more clarifications on this small specific?,"when i started i wasn't aware of the ppp because i was new. i was joining the system, but didn't people that i joined. they were not really, at this level of the lab, the level of involvement wasn't at the satisfactory level. so one of the recommendations, because i think these people will happen maybe not today, but let's say the future. you, so let's start with the, with the lowest level. well, these are people who are going to, to implement the ppp we have talking about. so we start by the lowest level. and, um, as you said, bottom up to make sure that actually we move with the whole package of the needs that people understands them and the way to fill up, to overcome them to the highest level. so this is one, important recommendation that i have been making when it comes to this ppp that i would like also to share. ",28,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
if ahdp is providing technical support and facilitating financing for the ppp how will the availability of this support affect the ppp design?,"no, i'm not involved. i'm not involved in lab, we provide supports to the ministry of health on how to do ppp in health sector by offering the guidance on financial and economic component, and financial support as well in case needed.",29,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"when you look in the country what we have in place, legal framework and all the policies that we have regulatory frameworks are they supportive of ppp?",i don't know about that project. ,30,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"and so let's discuss then if you can describe different earlier, for example, experiences that you have projects in country, in lab, any other experience in public private partnerships in rwanda?","that's basically the technical question for ministry of health. and when we do ppp as a country this is just for us to transfer risks to private partner or attracting financing for a given project. so for this particular labs management in rwanda for technical aspects, the ministry of health is in the position to elaborate more. ",31,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
then you said that you had some ppp with abbott. can you explain how it worked? so what was exactly this ppp abbott?,those should be educated by the feasibility study findings. i cannot discuss findings if i don't have the feasibility study conducted. ,32,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
how trusting is the relationship between public and private sectors for health based on the past experience?,"themajor objective of a ppp feasibility study, whether labs or health sector in general or any other sector is to indicate, what kind of ppp arrangement to undertake, whether it is build, operate and transferbotor they build, operate and ownboo , or contract management. those are the areas that a feasibility study should clearly indicate",33,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
we are looking at the historic investment and interest from government in lab?,"we have ppp law we have also, ppp feasibility study guidelines, which tries to guide sectors, including the health sector on how to proceed with ppp.",34,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
what is the profile of health workers that are working in the lab diagnostic system in rwanda?,"a ppp feasibility study has three major components. one is the technical component. that normally is reviewed and confirmed by the contracting authority. if we say contracting authority in this case, it is moh. there is another component called financial and economic viability of the project. once it is technically feasible, it must be financially viable for the investor to come and invest in the project. it must be economically viable, especially for the government. if we say financial viability, it is when it has financial returns both to the investors as government and private party. ",35,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
who are the key stakeholders in the ppp and why do you think these people or institutions are involved?,"let me give you a quick scenario, especially for us minecofin. that's why i was saying, i will give you a general overview of how minecofin oversee the implementation of the ppp in rwanda, when a project is financially, whether we have health sector or agriculture or construction, any other sector, when a project is financially viable and economically viable, that project should be implemented by a private sector, whether in ppp or a private party alone. but when it is financially feasible, not economically feasible, that product is mainly implemented by the private investor. when it is only economically feasible, that really should be implemented by the government.so in the case of the ppp labs the preliminary findings indicated that the project is economic viable, but not financially viable. so that's why there are some components where the technical team said go and improve on this. and then we shall see whether the project is still not financially feasible. i cannot give the details of what made this project, not financially viable. so those are the scenarios i wanted you to understand whether in health sector or any other sector, but specifically for the labs, the preliminary findings indicated that the project is not financially viable.",36,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"so the next question, when you look at this list, we want to know how these different institutions, who, how do they perceive the, the advantages and disadvantages with the ppp?","in this case, it can be implemented only by the government because it is economically viable. but the major reasons were from the projected revenues where the revenues should come from, the reagents and consumables, the number of tests, trainings, and other expenditure were not making the projects financially viable. if the consumables and reagents they can change in either direction, so if they can increase or decrease, you can understand how the findings are going to be, what i know is that the preliminary reports that we have, the technical team has indicated that the feasibility study of the project is not financially viable, you can understand that you would not keep asking me the questions around the technical viability because those are the technical aspects, that is not my area, mine is finance and economics. i cannot comment on the technical part. what we do is just to help the sectors, to understand the importance of how assessing the economic and financial viability of the project. ",37,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"and then how threatening to the success of the ppp is the, a potential for turnover in key position among national actors?","no, it depends at what stage the ppp is. is it under implementation? is it under study? so i want to clearly understand at which stage you are talking about? ",38,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
how threatening is it the turnover to the ppp process itself? ,"if i can get you well, we should note that there are different stages of the ppp project. i'm not sure if you can hold accountable someone for a project that is not yet started. so once it has already started, of course before you go into the implementation of the ppp there is a concession agreements that is signed, normally our ppps are for 25 years concession period government has obligations and the private party has obligations depending on the nature ofarrangement of the project, if it's a bot, boo or contract management. so in this case we were trying to see how the guidance was to check the operational and management of the labs. so, depending on the nature of the arrangement, we can be able to identify who is accountable for the success of the ppp, because each party has obligation. government has obligations to fulfill, and the private party has obligations to fulfill during the concession period. ",39,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"can you maybe explain that more like the system change, what you mean by the system change?","yeah, like i said the contracting authority in this case, ministry of health, according to our ppp law, moh can initiate the ppp project or a private partner can come up with a proposal for the implementation of lab management, for example in our hospitals. so the feasibility study is ongoing and is at technical level we have provided our feedback to the institution that is conducting and supporting technically on the feasibility study. ",40,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
so then the next question is how interested are private partners in participating in ppp?,"first of all, we have a contracting authority in this case it is the ministry of health. because you are interested in health sector, in order words it can be rbc, but not a hospital. because a hospital is not a contracting authority nor a budget agency, they should go through their line ministry. we have rdb, according to our law is the chief negotiator. when it comes to ppp implementation, there also mof for the finance and economic planning. if there is areas to do with the infrastructure, we should have ministry of infrastructure in case they need water, electricity, access to land, those are the agencies of public in most cases, involve in ppp assessment not implementation. ",41,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"what are the otherfactors that may limit the private sector working with the government in the public apart from havinglike very rigid system, following regulations?","in the case we need support on transaction, if we need further capacities or transaction, we normally engage some institutions.",42,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"what are the incentives for the private sector to work with the public system, to participate in a ppp in the country?","no it depends on the sector we have a pool of technical advisor who are in a position to provide the support needed, whether in terms of negotiating, whether we need further capacities with the private party, especially in areas where we think we don't have local capacities. ",43,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"when you look at the private partners that we have in country that are, what in laboratory diagnostic, do you think that they have the capacity to participate in a ppp with the government? ","there are very many, first of all our nst1 national strategic for transformation indicate that our economy should be a private sectored economy that where we have rdb. if you have a project and from the assessment, the analysis or from the feasibility study, the findings indicate that the project is financially viable, we normally take that project to private sector to come and implement the project. so the government policies, including our national investment policy clearly indicate we should have private sector engagement in doing the implementation of the major projects. ",44,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"so do you think that these private partners that we have in country, if they're provided with more fundings, if they can really provide the support needed for a ppp?","we have incentives under investment code. yes. including tax exemption, infrastructure access. for example, you want to build a hospital. the government provides with you access load, internet, connectivity, water electricity, for you to be able to implement your project. ",45,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"looking at scale up and sustainability, especially when looking at, when discussing around the ppp design. so the question is what are, or could be the plans in place to support public sector financing of diagnostics in the future?","so far, there is no obstacles because you have incentives. we have good environment that attracts private sector to come and partner with government of rwanda. we have the different capacities locally that if you come and do a project, there is some capacity that you don't need to go and outsource outside. so i think so far, i donâ€™t see any issues with private sector who partner with the government. ",46,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"so currently, what are the different sources of financing for lab diagnostics?","i'm not sure if you have a ppp project in labs, there is no ppp project. what you have is in the pilot phase. we are trying to check on how to roll out actually, so we welcome many private partners to come and work with government as a private partner in ppp. ",47,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"then if you look at your, your financing plans that you have are they sustainable?","because like i said before, a ppp feasibility study has three major components because there are others. one is the technical feasibility of the project, is labs technical feasible in rwanda, can we have labs that can produce different tests with this kind of technology? is it feasible in rwanda? do we have hospital that can accommodate these type of labs in rwanda? and then if it is technically feasible, whether you do a pilot phase, you need to roll out. but if you want to conduct a pilot, you do what we call pre-feasibility study. so once is technically feasible, like i said before. so in other words, this can be feasible in rwanda. i don't know whether maybe you want to rollouts across?",48,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
so is there anything else that you would like to discuss about ppp that we have not talked about?,"no, this is what the feasibility study does. the study should be able to assess the technical viability of the project. can a lab be accommodated in a health post? those are the areas that technical part or component of the study assesses. and then you go into other components including financial and economic viability and other components, but if we want to conduct a pilot, you go to the pre-feasibility study and when it works, you roll out. ",49,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"thank you very much for your willingness to participate. i have took you really a very good time for your day. and, as i stated at the beginning, if the ppp move ahead to contracting, we will conduct a second round of interview. and if you agree, we may reach out again in the next few months to schedule another interview with you to see what to capture the new perspective, according to the development. thank you very much. ","there are two sources the one is the private investor, second is government of rwanda and government of rwanda has different sources, domestic finances and external financing. and again, it depends on the nature of the ppp project. we have ppp projects where an investor can come and say, i'm going to build a facility, let's say hospital, and then i'm going to run it over 30 years and then transfer it to the government. but in that case what the government does, is to provide a land and an infrastructure as i was saying, so in that case, who is financing the project, it's the private sector.so there is other cases where they can form a joint-venture, each party bring 50, and then you implement the project. so in those cases, it's private investor and government, for the investor may be the financing will come from borrowing, while for the government it will come from domestic financing or external financing. it depends also on the findings of the feasibility study. so specifically for the labs we are trying to assess on how the investor can equip all the health facilities and then we collect through testes because it's just to upgrade our existing labs.so the study is trying to assess different options. the ppp feasibility study in most cases we commend sectors to do what we call option analysis, to test different options and then check the option that that is good for government.",50,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_6
"the first question that we have for you, can you tell us your role and how you were involved in laboratory diagnostics in rwanda? ","those are stakeholders. because the hospitals, collect living through insurance premiums. so those are clients. those are clients like any other client. ",1,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
yeah. okay. so you are not familiar with african health diagnostic platform currently being discussed in rwanda?,"no, i donâ€™t think i have much to add because the ppp area in rwanda is nearly new. we still have opportunities for people to know and come and do the projects with government. so in health sector, there are many areas of ppp. we have lots of hospitals, but according to our nst1 we have targets to reach. so if we can get investors to build some hospitals in rwanda, it's an area that government can consider even more incentives. and specifically for labs, you know, the government through the ministry of health are trying to improve health service delivery. so if your labs are not providing, good services to patients do not expect the good health service delivery that why this study, once it is done there is a lot to do with the hospitals and even down to the posts, but currently they study is trying to cover the hospitals. ",2,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
"yeah. and from your standpoint, what are the key issues that a ppp aiming to improve laboratory diagnostic services should focus on to be successful? ","thank you very much for taking me part of this study, it is my pleasure to participate in interview. my role actually will be as a medical doctor and also a managing director of a public hospital in rwanda. ",3,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
"and maybe for you, the specific question would be what are the costs and benefits of pursuing a ppp in laboratory diagnostics ","so, i came to cross more of this platform just couple of days ago while i have been reached out to participate in this study and i had actually to get informed about this, otherwise previously i was not aware about this platform. thank you. ",4,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
"so the study should highlight this, according to you?","thank you very much. actually, if a private partner can contract with public for the better service of the laboratory there must be a proper treatment plan for the patients. this will actually help in two ways on my point of view, rather those mentioned on the paper will guide in the procurement process of gathering reagents and, or just platform, this means machines and so on. sometimes procurement process may cause problems of the hospitals actually on timeliness and efficiency. and also without running the stock outs, when private contracts are in, they will help to make sure their business is running effectively.",5,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
"okay. and now, how supportive is the existing policy or legal framework in rwanda with regards to ppp?","to my understanding, when we are trying to do the procurement process and having those reagents delivered, sometimes we end up having the issues of the reagents coming because of their half-life, and we end up having some reagents that can be expired or getting them arrived late because of the issues of transportation and so on. ",6,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
"okay. if you can elaborate more about that improvement that is being done is it about laboratory networks, is it the sample transportation?","yeah, exactly. when we have all the exams available at the hospital, there will be a chance for those poor patients to be able to get full examination and they are examined and then get treated at the same hospital level without getting those transfers that also are very costly to the patients, that is socioeconomic side of the patients. and those who are very sick patients or complicated cases will get examined and diagnosed and treated at the hospital where specialists will be appointed, and that will be a very good thing to our country as we are getting all specialists appointed at every hospital.",7,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
yeah. actually what you say is very important for us because for a successful ppp it has to go through all those mentioned steps.,"on my understanding, i think there will be a benefit to the hospital as there will be a guarantee of getting all the platforms functional and the availability of reagents and maintenance of the machines. so that means on the side of the hospital you are sure that all the vulnerable patients that you can have, there will be a guarantee that all the time we have all the lab system that will be functional. so that is a very positive point on my understanding as sometimes we end up getting some reagents or broken platforms, and we may experience some periods without getting a functional platform. so i think this will be really very beneficial to have the private sector managing the side of the lab that will be really very important. ",8,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
"so it means according to what you mentioned, it should be implemented by?","so, i think my answer is a bit limited on this point, as there is some legal aspect that i have not get crossed with, but on my understanding, we need to have a very regulatory system that has to be in contact with their performance, on a regular basis, and with also the accuracy of the results that are being taken and that can be detected at the early stage for any failure aspect of the system, and then try to see what can be addressed at early stage. so, i think we need to have a very structured way of follow up on this kind of partnership, otherwise it will be a challenge on the health system, functioning. ",9,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
"thank you very much, actually. that is very clear. and maybe my next question is to know who should be held accountable for the success of ppp. ","i think if i can give you an example, we have in our hospital, we have abbott that we are working together, they have delivered their platforms and these direct contact with them to deliver the reagents. and this is very helpful to our functioning laboratory. and, this is different to the actual way of having the procurement process that sometimes also take time and people may not be able to honor their commitment. so, with the abbott that will be able to maintain their platforms and be able to change their platform where they are deficient and deliver at time of needed reagents it makes life easier. and, we are working actually smooth in our laboratory.",10,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
"â€™s questionmaybe the whole process of the ppp project, from starting to the deliverables under the selected contract modalities or ppp","there are two main situations that i can identify, first people that have that believe of competition can lead to the delivery of a better service. the second is just people that can fear to change from the system to another, because they're not sure how effectively that new system can work.",11,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
"historically, what has been the investments and interest from the government in laboratory diagnostics? ","so, i think it can be flexible after identifying the disadvantages and advantages and how the current system is working and the benefits we can gain from this kind of partnership. so i think a government should look careful the consent to adoption of this kind of partnership because it is very beneficial. ",12,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
okay. so who are key stakeholders that should be involved in developing the ppp and why?,"thank you very much. as i said, looking at the one we have with abbott, historically there is a success story about this relationship. and it has been very fruitful relationship and very effective at hospital level. and, that helped too much patients coming seeking for medical attention and then be able to get a very good package of clinical examination, laboratory examination, and also imaging. this really improved the good decision making to clinicians therefore a very specific treatment for the disease, which is very helpful for patients.",13,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
"and at international level, is there other key stakeholders who should be involved as well? ","so, the experience is there. i think thanks to the good leadership and a well-structured way to follow the implementation, when all parties are fulfilling their role in the contract. and i talked about abbott it has been a good experience and it has been giving good results. ",14,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
and what about funders are they also involved?,yes,15,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
yeah. thank you very much. what are the factors now which can facilitate or attract the private partners to be involved in the ppp?,"so, abbott just brought the very updated and automatic platform that are able to run multiple exams of different samples at a time and, this actually decreased the turnaround time of the all investigations that have been running out in laboratory, and, now we are able to generate these results, in biochemistry, in immune-serology, in hematology, and other areas in a very short time, at least in one hour. therefore, the clinicians can make a good decision and start the curative treatment at the very early stage. and, they are keeping their platforms in good status; all the maintenance at a very early stage, preventive maintenance and creative maintenance. ",16,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
and what kind of biggest incentives for private partners to participate in the ppp?,"i think at policy level, they need to get these kinds of ideas and set the policy of how things will run, but also at the end users, we have to see their specific needs at their level and end up being able to request the specific machines that can respond to their needs, because all the health facilities are not on the same level. and so, i think the governance, when there is good decentralization and the government need to see above and make a framework of working, and then the hospitals will have the roles of making specifications of what they need, and then they will have the authority to follow up if their needs are very responded.and then at the policy level have also a way of following if the implementation is going okay and if the needs that were identified before are timely responded to as wished. ",17,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
and what are the biggest drawbacks for private sector to participate in ppp?,"i think everyone has its role to play, if there is any gap in the policy level that means at the policy level they have to be held accountable. but, again for the implementers of this partnership at the hospital level, they need actually to see if everything is going well and make sure to communicate in case there is any problem so that it can be solved as soon as possible as at the hospital level, they are the ones dealing with the platforms. so, i think actually there should be a concession argument before getting the implementation and everyone get to know his/her part clearly and then he/she can held accountable in case of the failure to play the role accordingly.",18,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
so do you think that the private partners working in a laboratory diagnostics in country have the capacity to participate and deliver on ppp? ,"i think, the investment is there from the very performing hospitals at teaching hospital level till the health post. there is a very huge investment done by the hospital. but we have also those investment as a reasoning contract, as i said, as abbott and also others in terms of actually getting all health workers at different levels to be able to do their, the investigations and take decision at early stage. so, this actually has a very huge investment on the government of rwanda that we have a lot of hospitals and all with labs that are very functional and helping clinicians at their level without getting patients transferred because of investigations not done. ",19,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
how could the ppp be designed to achieve scale up and sustainability?,"so, it would align with the government priorities, because we need actually to get all the population treated and get actually the health system going down to the decentralized level the very remote areas. so that's why the government invested a lot by constructing a lot of hospitals in the district level, and at sector level, now going down to the health post, just for identifying all these infections at the community level and also nutrition status of patients and so on. so, that we can get healthy population that can contribute to the effective development of the country. ",20,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
may be geographic scalability? ,"yeah, so the training is very organized. actually we have different universities that are training their student at the university level, diploma levellab technician , also bachelor's degreelab scientists , so that they're able to manipulate those platforms and be able to run actually those needed investigations and then when they finish their studies they continue being trained while working at different hospitals to get some refresher trainings or any adaptation of a new system.",21,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
thank you so much. so now which are different sources of funding are expected to be used for financing diagnostics?,"so, stakeholders actually should be the ministry of health as a part of the policy makers, and we need also to involve the legal aspect. if i can say the ministry of justice to have all the legal aspect of those contractors in line with our regulatory bodies and everything, and also the management of the hospitals should be involved to assess the benefits that we could gain from that ppp, because they are the end users they should be part of the decision at the introduction of the ppp in order to embrace those changes. ",22,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
are the national health insurances also can be involved in?,"i think the first person who will be interested to get these diagnostic happening in public are the clinicians that need the system to learn quickly so that they can help their patients, regardless of which process, what matters is the time around time of every investigation requested and how fast they can get actually everything. but again the investors actually can get hurt if they are not the one chosen, to be part of the contract to invest in the private area to get profit, in this case things are not available in the private hospitals so that they can attract people in the private sector. but the government can only benefit if their population is treated well even to the lower level when services are being accessed down there so they can be healthy. ",23,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
"so i think many questions i have tackled on them, so unless you have anything else you would like to discuss about the ppp that we have not talked about. ","so, on my understanding, i think that if all services would be rendered at a public level probably there will be a private business that would not be functional as usual. so, i think there will be some investors in private that cannot be happy with that because they are making money since all the tests are not in public hospitals so you can find them in private. so i think that's my point of view they can both benefit if they keep running as usual.",24,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
thank you very much for your time and we shall be interacting with you in case the ppp moves ahead to contracting. i wish you a good evening.,"first of all, will be a patient, but second will be the clinician, and lastly will be actually the government because the patients, their population are treated effectively at the health facilities. ",25,rwa-int-pe-2022_03_28
thank you very much. so can you describe your role as it is related to the laboratory diagnostic in rwanda?,"so, i think the other part that is not involved in the joint public private venture on my own understanding the one who should be threatened is the investor who did not sign the contract so he/she can be involved in the business.",1,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_03
"okay. thank you very much. so, as a medical doctor are you familiar with african health diagnostics platform currently being discussed in rwanda? ","so i think for sure they will be interested because they are just making platforms to get their consumables used. if they have a stable contract, a stable areas to invest, they will be sure that they can easily make profits a win-win situation. they just bring actually the platforms and they'll be actually able to run for them. also actually it'll be a stable market for them. it'll not be a kind of going for a competition or elsewhere. i think this actually will be a very beneficial actually to those who will be winning the contract. ",2,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_03
"okay, thank you very much. we understand that you have not been exposed to this kind of discussion of the african health diagnostic platform. first, i want to ask you some questions about how different factors should influence the design of ppp.","so, the biggest incentive will be the support of the government and the support of the environment of the business, actually which is supportive. that will be the biggest incentive and the security of their investment. and seeing that locally there are other investment that has been going on which can be their lesson to learn on.",3,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_03
"so, from your standpoint, what are the key issues that the ppp or any contracting modalities aiming to improve laboratory diagnostic services should focus on or include to be successful? ","so, unstable politics of the governments of a country and security, and that can be actually their biggest drawback and unstable economy of a country i think for my side that can be the biggest drawback of the private partners to invest. ",4,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_03
thank you. you just talk about the cost effectiveness; can you elaborate a bit mores the ppp can improve in a way of cost effectiveness and efficient? ,"so, i think they have, yes, the capacity to participate as they have shown the ability and the strength to make these things successful. i mentioned above that we have already running abbott a kind of partnership which is working properly. ",5,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_03
"thank you what can you say about some need of priorities, for example, the poorest household and the complicated patients, how this kind of vulnerable group can be taken care of? ","so, the design of the ppp should be protective and in case it is not implemented properly there should be a way of terminating the contract. but again, there should be an assessment that monitor if their goals are well achieved on regular basis. so that we can see if the project is running effectively, and if it's responding to the questions identified previously so that we can see, how it'll be going. the regular monitoring and evaluation of the success based on the expectations of this partnership is needed to see if everything is in implementation of the contract. ",6,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_03
"thank you very much. so, what are the costs and benefits of pursuing a ppp for the lab diagnostic this time?","as i said previously, we have different level of hospitals, their needs also are different and their capability to treat are different. they can expand services also going up if they are able to do that. why not expand to a level of pathology, examinations of the lab. this kind of also partnership can also involve the imaging service, why not? because we know that sometimes hospitals cannot afford like big machines like ct scan or mri and so on. so we can scale up with not only the lab but also with other kind of partnerships that hospitals can benefit from. ",7,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_03
"thank you very much. so, the next series of questions are about how the policy context and the different stakeholders should shape the public private partnership design, or the contract modalities. ","the plans in place that can support that is the political will and the policy that are supportive of that. and we have also human source that are place that are ready to use the new technology. so, i think if everything combined with the political will and the good environment, everything can come together to support those investors. ",8,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_03
"so, how supportive is the existing policy legal and regulatory framework for the ppps?","a good environment combines the political will, and the policy makers that are flexible to see how they can work together to get everything and being able to have a continuous evaluation. with the support with working together with those investors. i think this is in general, including also a kind of security and other facilities that can attract investors. ",9,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_03
"okay. thank you very much, but can you elaborate more if the current regulatory framework, the current policy, current policies, are supportive of this ppp?","source of funding can be coming from the services, those services will be sold. so, when you are selling service, then you generate money. that is actually a service that we would sell, and then we generate money. but also you can have partnership with partners that can fund the health system, but the population themselves can also finance by generating kind of insurance. and then insurance can be a source of financing, those expenses and then, but also the government can come in to finance those services and generate money to pay back. ",10,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_03
thank you very much. do you think that there will be a resistance among policy makers for this ppp? ,"so, from my point of view when the services are available, you just sell the service and generate money, but by generating money you end up by treating patients and when they are not very sick, they can also participate in different activities and they can generate taxes to the government.i think government, when it invests in peopleâ€™s health, it is a factory that helps the government generating money in different ways.",11,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_03
"yeah. so, how flexible is the ppp to change in government, or government priority? ","on my point of view, they can be sustainable if the cost is affordable. so, i think making a good negotiation for low price because the market is big. i think for me, with the experience of managing the hospital, this is very sustainable if it is well managed. ",12,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_03
"so, historically, how have public and private sector focusing on health interacted, in terms of trust, collaborative the relationship is?","so, then you have to get actually a good political will, as i said, mandatory as it need to be there before anything else, and practically it can be viable because the government has set the guidelines and legal framework for ppp, so the government is ready to raise fund for the viability of the ppp. with a strong system, a political will, and a stable government in ideal situation the financial viability is possible ",13,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_03
"and so what other earlier experiences or projects have there been in country that can provide the lessons for african health, diagnostic platform? ",i think we have talked everything; i have nothing to add on that. ,14,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_03
"so, you talked about that you are having abbott in your hospital. ","i think everything has been discussed, the list is okay, ",15,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_03
"so, can you relate a little bit on how this is good experience that the african health diagnostic platform can build on? ",thank you very much. yeah. i will be glad to participate. ,16,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_03
"how will health system governance arrangementse.g. decentralization, devolutionaffect the ppp design and pre-tender process?","just make sure i understand the framing of the study, for the topic what exactly is included in the african health diagnostic platform, does that pertain to the recent investments by the european investment bank, or what exactly is included in that?",17,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_03
"so who should be held accountable for the success of the ppp, or the deliverables under the selected contract modalities? ","okay, just to clarify, you know my involvement with the lab was directly with the rbc and working on a specific investment from the european investment bank, i think there have been different processes that are falling slightly different channels, and, you know, the one i've been involved in was directly under the leadership of rbc. you know negotiating with eib and who is also involved because there will be providing some technical assistance it's to invest in a new laboratory for national health laboratory servicesthe nhls . and that's i guess it is a form of ppp.",18,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_03
thank you very much. so what has been the historic investment and interest from the government in laboratory diagnostic? ,"no, i'm not. i can't say i am honestly.",19,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_03
"so, how does improvement in laboratory diagnostic align with the government priorities for the health sector? ","no, i mean the discussions we were having with rbc, i mean this was obviously, initially with dg of rbc and the whole team at rbc and then you know who is there as well. but there is a group of core group that set up to work on, on the future reference lab for rbc, and that's under eid funding plus, eu delegation funding and their order to set up a new basically. i think it's about security level three, i think that was the latest to set up key laboratory services.",20,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_03
"thank you very much. so what is the profile of health workers relative to the diagnostic system, including training cadres and, unionization and other aspect? ","so the process, i was involved in, is to negotiate two separate grants that come from european union. one is a large 20 million euro grants from the european investment bankeib . and the second grant is a direct grants to who to provide technical assistance to support the project and provide expertise to ensure that, the lab infrastructure project is carried out well and that's a separate grant.",21,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_03
"so, who do you think that are the key stakeholders that should be involved in developing the ppp and why?","well i think, you know, you have different stakeholders, working in different manners, and that in itself creates a challenge right i mean you have eib that works in a very administrative form and their procedures.",22,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_03
"so, whose interests are helped or hurt by laboratory diagnostic happening in the public versus the private sector?","as far as i know, i thinkagain, last week i was on personal leave you know besides, i know there's been a lot of movementslast month, and i think this was submitted to eib for consideration , soit was finalized and submitted as you could tell.",23,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_03
"so, in other words, do you think that some people would have the benefit of having the lab or the diagnostic services be accessed in the public as it is in the private sector?","so, initially it was mostly the leadership of rbc, so, obviously, you know the initial leadership was under the dg of rbc so at the time was the former dg he created a task force to work on this, the chairman of the task force or core team was the former head of department of biomedical services and i can't recall exactly what name we ended up with but i was the vice chair. it included also different members the head of mti from rbc you know what i'm talking about medical maintenance, equipment and infrastructure and all of that. so there was a deputy dg, there was the coordinator of spiu from rbc, there was who and the person changed at some points, but there was somebody from who, there was someone who is acting as kind of support, technical assistance to rbc.",24,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_03
"okay, that's good. so, who would benefit the most from the joint public private venture? ","yeah, rwanda housing authority and minicofin, and maybe others i'm not sure i would have to dig through my emails because you know i know a lot happened in the last couple of weeks. ",25,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_03
"so, who would be potentially threatened by the ppp? ","i mean, yeah, i mean, to the extent to which rbc is under moh, so, in a way, you know.",26,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_03
"so, how interested do you think private partners might be in participating in the ppp? ","so, the initial design was very rough i think the project has different stages you know, now as part of the procurements, part of it is the design. so phase one of the project as part of the work that's supposed to be carried out under eib funding as well as under the who funding.",27,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_03
so what are the biggest incentive for private partners to participate in ppp? ,"no, not the country director no, it was a couple people who were husband and wife. and i would have to dig out who they were, but i don't remember their name out of my head, itâ€™s been a while. so they participated in that, in those meetings. there were a few meetings. initially, that were actually informal meetings, and i remember the people from the chai asked who was leading the procurement of the project, they asked whether that was enabel funded project, or who was funding the project, which is when we have started discussion procedure. here, you know, is this the procurement procedure is this brainstorming and what is this process.",28,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_03
"so, what are the biggest drawback for private partners to participate in ppp? ","right, well when i think back you know, from the very first kind of informal brainstorming, that we have two years ago andi thinkthe confusion of the lack of clarity of respective accountabilities led to us, not knowing who was supposed to, who was responsible for what. and i think that led to delays, you know, when you have unclear accountabilities. you don't know who's responsible for delivering something and by when and if they don't, then who is supposed to come after them and tell them, you're supposed to deliver, you didn't deliver. so who is supposed to do that right? so, what, when you don't have their responsibilities.",29,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_03
"so, do you think that private partners working in the laboratory diagnostic in rwanda have the capacity to participate and deliver on the ppp? ","so i know it was felt by my colleague, who's working with rbc as a technical advisor so you know he's the one who was pushing to hire that project manager type of person it was clear that we needed a person like that, and you know it was not his role or to be acting as a project manager. so, yeah,i know he was feeling the same.",30,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_03
"so, how ppp could be designed to achieve a scale up and sustainability ","so, you know, the division has always been under the umbrella of the dg of rbc that i think if i had to name a champion i would say he was the champion behind it, right? so, the dg of rbc was the champion. but, you know, clearly, he has other responsibilities, which is why i think he appointed that core team.",31,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_03
"what would scale up look like for this ppp, for example, at the level of the geographical scale up, expanding to other facilities, adding new diagnostic? what do you think in the scale up at national level, even at lower level?

what are the plans in a place to support public sector financing over diagnostic in the future?,"so i mean, i donâ€™t want to blame him.what i can say is thatthe mandate of that core team was not clearly established so when you don't have a clear mandate for either the team as an entity or individuals within the team, it makes it very hard to do anything right so on.",33,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_03
what do you mean by good environment? ,"so i guess itâ€™s a good question. so, yeah, the turnover at the national lab did not help, you know, there was definitely a change. people have their usual responsibilities, i think that the former hod was doing his phd at some point in belgium. so he had the other things to worry about. then the current hod changed. so, you know, i don't know all the inner workings of rbc and what's going on.",34,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_03
"so, which different source of funding are expected to be used for financing diagnostics?","i think the initial vision was good i think it was. you know, i think the overall vision and the kind of the strategic direction was good. it's just that when it comes to implementation and getting organized i think the work plan and accountabilities thatâ€™s where things got confused.",35,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_03
"so, how government increased the financing support to diagnostic during the ppp period? ","opposite directions, i wouldn't say opposite directions, but, i think one thingwhat we realized is that, from the very early discussions you know whenchai was involved they made a clear statements that they wanted to bid for this project so they wanted to be funded to work on it. so, you know they wanted to claim the part about design of the concept of the project, the national lab, but they wanted to work on the design, theyâ€™re not infrastructure experts so they didn't want to work on construction parts, but they did want to work on the design of the lab.",36,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_03
"is this financing plan, you are talking about sustainable, so, and why, and why not?","yeah so they wanted to bid for that element. and in this case, i guess they could sense that there was going to be funding coming in, and they wanted to position themselves to bid for it so it's a bit of a weird situation where you have a technical partner that you work with, but then they wanted to bid for funding.",37,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_03
"so, how are the different source of funding being considered? you talked about, taxes, insurance and income generating. so, how these sources of funding be considered politically viable.

"thank you very much. if you have the last paper, you can look at it and see if we may have missed any potential respondent. you see the last paper, there's a list of potential respondents if you have went through, you can indicate us which one we have missed out. we can addthem. ","well, i would say all of them can have a role, or, maybe, should play a role i mean ideally, you should consider every different risk or every one of those factors, assess how they're going to influence the project.you need to analyze also which stakeholders are on the table. what is their influence what is their interest, why they're on the table?",40,rwa-int-pe_2022_02_03

"yeah, there were other ministries, also?","i mean i worked for private sector in the past, so, i think there is different level of interest right in ppp for the private sector. you know, one is pure, see what they callcsrcorporate social responsibility, which is goodwill, just because it looks nice to do something to help low income countries.so, thatâ€™s one, so, thatâ€™s like a separate world, right?i'm not sure it's a true ppp, or if it's like standards development projects. so, there is that element in private companies, but, when you look at the core business, putting aside the csr and elements. normally private companies who are successful, you know they have service or products they sell and they can make money and usually they're good private company, it goes very well. they don't need anybody else to do it, right? when they want to enter in the ppp is that there is something else they want to get out of it, right? so either it's because they want to test a new approach, new product, enter a new markets and new way of doing things that there is something they want to get out of a ppp, and you need to figure out what it is? it could be that, there is a new machine they want to test, there is a new test, and they want to try.",12,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_7
anyone from the ministry of health?,"depends on interest and you have to read the fine print first because they want to maximize, they're very good at negotiating contracts, getting the best deals for them. so, you have a small unit, when youâ€™re the government and you're dealing with a private company, you know you have a big private company, it's not dealing like with enabel, or you said you know you come in and they want to get the best deal possible, so you have to read the fine print, because they're going to try to get the best possibility for them. so, yeah, definitely will have a strong team of negotiators. they're tough cookies. ",13,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_7
"that's good. okay, so, how the initial design changes during the deliberation.","sure, yeah, and don't confuse them for standards development partners, they're not, they are not nice and kind as enabel or whoever else.",14,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_7
it was maybe? country director?,"it's a good question. i don't think there's a quick answer to that, i think. it's not an easy one because it kind of goes back to, you know, you have to walk through kind of the difference in financing steps and thinking, well, where does the money come from, right? is it going to come from mutuelle, or is it coming from the people paying premium, so, is it going to come from the standard mutuelle, where, you know, in terms of revenue generation. ",15,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_7
"very good. i think so. as you know there were so many changes and how do the changes would affected the process, or would have affected the process? ","i think the government has done quite a lot, theyâ€™ve been involved in negotiating with different companies. i don't know the details of the different deals or negotiations.i know that, dealing or interacting directly with different private sectors, you know, abbott deal there is a different deal with the pcr testing and whatnot. so i'm not directly involved in those negotiations so i don't know the details of those deals. i know that the government and rbc probably mostly are involved in those negotiations and discussions. i don't know what's in the details of those agreements.",16,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_7
"so, is this kind of frustration you felt as vice chair of the task force was also felt among other team members?","i think they have the potential to be sustainable, just that they're there. if we go on in an unregulated manner it's not going to be sustainable, because a lab is going to do as many test as they possibly can. they want to milk the cow, as much as they can. and i would say if i have a lab, that's what it would do, right?i mean you know there's ethical considerations but if you cut down to the essential business you're going to manage their profit and they're going to try to maximize their profits, right?and that's what any businessman would do, right?so you know youâ€™re going to try to do as many lab test as you can.",17,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_7
yeah. so who has been championing of this ppp support?,"no, itâ€™s interesting, i'm just curious about a lot of the discussions would be very relevant to the government of course you know. so whatâ€™s your plan for, i mean, i understand the clients are more like johns hopkins university and the gates and but, does the government, at some point, how are you going to engage with the government and share your findings with them, you know, is there going to be a platform for discussing this and i'm just curious about enough.",18,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_7
but what you did under this division was not clearly channeled? who was the chair of the task force?,"okay, well.",19,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_7
yeah. meaning that he was not owning the process?,"my pleasure. i'm looking for, i hope i will get to see the result of your work at some point you know this is very interesting ",20,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_7
"and it was the same scenario with before the new hod was alert for example, so it was the same maybe the new hod was coming in, maybe not owning it. and the dg having the overall vision, but not really involved. so, what the same with that old team. because we used to have, for example the former hod and colleagues from national reference lab. do you think that ambiguity was due to this change?","it will lead to interesting debate and discussions in the health sector, so i would love to see the results.",21,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_7
"yeah, understand that. ok, so the change has affected them. the problem with this ownership, even if the vision was a clear, at least ","yeah, that's good. that sounds good. thank you very much, good luck.",22,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_7
do you think that there has been any actors trying to propose opposite direction from the main actor working in ppp?,i was not involved at all. okay. ,23,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_7
to bid for the design?,"no, i think there is no formal engagement that i had in this project. i just hear it from friends who were either who participated or who were involved, but me particularly have not been involved in this process. ",24,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_7
"so, how would the ppp design address key considerations to improve the access of laboratory diagnostic if ppp is proposed?",it was not. ,25,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_7
"do you think that ppp can improve the availability of equipment and the reagent, and also improve the quality and efficiency? what do you say about the affordability? if the ppp is approved can you elaborate more on quality, availability, efficiency and affordability?","no, only know that it was about the lab and i don't know much about the details of this particular ppp.",26,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_7
"thank you very much.so, what factors, do you think, changed the discussion around the ppp? ","yes. i think one of my other meetings, i met during lunch, my colleagues who were in this ppp meeting. and i remember to have met people from chai from, moh or rbc, and who else i heard about abbott as well. ",27,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_7
"yeah, thank you for the comment so, if the african health diagnostic platform is providing for example technical support, and facilitating the financing for this ppp, how would the availability of this support affect the ppp design. ","no, i don't recall anyone like trying to oppose to that.",28,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_7
"thank you very much. so, let us go for the context now. so that was the design so now the following question will be about how policy context and the different stakeholders shaped the ppp design?","to me rdb i don't know if they were part of it, but i think it's one of the institution, at least that i know, that has built, has that institutional capacity to analyze the offering in the areas of ppp. although of course, moh as main recipient wouldn't have technical details to contribute to, but i think the two, if they worked together, they would do, i don't know if they participated, obviously moh but i donâ€™t know about rdb. because i know there is a ppp guideline by rdb and i have we as my institution, the rssb we have been discussing with rdb on other ppp projects, and i think they have them expertise.",29,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_7
take time.,no i didn't take part in this discussion. ,30,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_7
"thank you, but based on your experience in health sector you have been there for a couple of years.so, do you think that on policy perspective, when the regulatory framework, do you think that these legal and policy, supportive to ppp or are opposing it?so do you think that they had some kind of obstruction or favoring context?","i think the lab network is something that moh has been working on to strengthen the lab capacity across from the, from the community health level up to the national level. so i think maybe when i hear ppp i hear more investment in the area and i think more investment means more availability and more quality, wherever there is demand. so i think it's a push into rwandans already the initiative that rwanda already had probably to do it faster and more efficiently than if there was no ppp. so i think in that push it means people in remote area areas people with diseases that are not common because you they're always government always focus on what is common and there's always funding for most common diseases, but as, the burden, the epidemiological burden is also changing towards ncds so i think it's an opportunity to invest in those new areas where,so i look at beneficiaries in remote areas and people who are economically not well off, but also look at people with specific diseases, these special conditions that would benefit from government investment, if were to wait for the governmentto go in to, for its investment plan. ",31,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_7
"yeah. so, what other recent or areas experience of the project have there been in country, that can provide lessons for this coming african health diagnostic platform?","i think that's the point i wanted to make is the financial viability. and i'm saying this from another experienceso the financial viability of the ppp itself, which means are the services we are providing affordable and are the inputs that are required to deliver the services are they covered by what we get from the, i don't know, from the fees that we charge. so the financial variability, but also affordability can the brand population either out of pocket or through the insurance. cause you know how much they contribute, something can be of good quality but not affordable. so i thinkthat is something to look at, to look what is the long term financing of this ppp because for five years you can come with the grant, you can come with a commitment from the company, but in the wrong run should be absorbed by the existing system. so which means people can afford it and if they can afford it also organizations that are managing the ppp can also be viable. the ppp is not causing any loss for a hospital for a private i don't know, i not public or private hospitals that are involved. i donâ€™t know if private is involved, but i think that's very key.",32,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_7
"yeah, thank you. so, what has been the historic investment and interest from the government in the laboratory diagnostic?","i think rwanda as part of the countries efforts to be the destinations, the distinction for most of investments, i think there is an improvement on the policy and the regulatory framework with the ease of doing business, ease of getting in touch with the public sector. if you want to engage in the people i can't talk from the other experiences that rdb is facilitating all these discussions. there is a steering committee. i donâ€™t how many ministers involved in the steering committee for ppp? there is a guideline, corruption is solo. i don't know on their improvements that are intended to attract investment, which i think are also valid for ppp. what i think that is not yet there is the mindset because when something is new know there are always, skepticism, particularly in the public sector, when they have not seen things work, effectively, there are always some skepticism. ",33,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_7
so how does the improvement in the laboratory diagnostic align with the government priorities for the health sector? ,i think so. ,34,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_7
"what is the profile of the health workers relative to the diagnostic system, including training, cadres, and even unionization? ","yes. i think in the health sector, particularly, i can think of in the health sector in general. yeah. can think of health post with the different stakeholders, one family health, sfh and individual investor. well,if i call them investor who are managing, running the facilities, the health post, i think there was a project between moh, eco bankand full and one family health have to open 500 health post, although they are not yet there, but that's a very good example. that's where i was taking the example of working well on numbers, i think on very good financial projections, because i think some of them are failing because of that. when you take one random health post, you might realize it is viable, but there are some that are by nature will not be viable. because there are two remote, very few people, but the cost running the facility is almost the same. ",35,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_7
"thank you very much for the answer. the previous question it's about the stakeholders, and i think that you responded to this question throughout our discussion, we can skip it and go to the following","we're now discussing the third investor. now everyone started, we give them the same numbers. it seems we are paying almost a third of what we should be paying per kilometer of ambulance if it was to be a run by a private investor. so it means there are subsidies, obviously that's what we need. and we need to have that very clear.",36,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_7
"so, maybe some questions may help you to respond to the question. who benefits the most from the joint public-private venture in laboratory diagnostic?","i think it was a very good one. they both public and private have a very clear interest in the project. the public wanted the rollout of, of post everywhere. we are far from reaching the target to have at least one post per sell which so, and the investor also wanted to make this work to show and to learn from rwanda's experience, but be able to expand in other context, in other african countries, mainly african. so i think collaboration and eco bank has the source of funding was also collaborative in a way. so what i think was, is lacking now is to keep an eye on the, on how the project is being run, because we should have had kpis to follow, to make sure that this is working according to our expectation. i think we can up only one, which is how many health posts that are open, but how many are financial viable? that is mobile. and yeah, so we'll start, we have now started seeing a trend of reduction. so we have more health post-closing than new health post opening. yeah. just cause we did not face that reality. ",37,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_7
yes,"yeah i think government has been keen in investing in the lab diagnostic and of course with the support of partners, including the global fund usaid, others as i was saying in the beginning there have been investment across all the lab networks how do you, they refer from one level to another, how, what is the required capacity, according to the disease, but the package of services that are available there. and they have even gone up to the community health level with those rapid diagnostic test. so i think investment have been there having it was think it was an institution at one point and referral lab having the institution in charge. now i think a division or something below a division, but is still like government throwing that this is an area that they need to keep strengthening over time. i can't tell how much there was a time. i was able to tell when i was in the ministry but the investments were there, but there was always a shortfall in building maintenance capacity. that's what i think was there is a challenge and monitoring quality of the diagnostics that.",38,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_7
"yeah, okay. who is potentially threatened by the ppp? ","yes. i think of obviously that there are two that i talked about already rdb because of their technical skills in analyzing and appraising ppp proposals, ministry of health and rbc, of course all are freight rs, mainly rbc is a technical stakeholder that is benefiting from this in partners, it doesn't matter as long as they bring in capacity and facilitating that discussion, but public institution, those are the one i can also add. rssb they're always not because i'm from rssb, but because they're always discussions, that exclude or assess me in the end, whereas you should have included or assess me in the beginning, because when you're projecting, how much you will charge per test, you need to think about who will be paying, who will be paying and because who will be paying also bring another perspective where will be the source of that funding. ",39,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_7
"how would the structure of the african health diagnostic platform project itself affect dynamics in the country level? and how have bmgf, chai, and eib influenced the country level, ppp dynamics? and also to what degree did they cross the country landing with the african health diagnostic platform project?","i think those particular institutions have particular interest and they look, i guess they look at the ppp in length of their own interests. so rdb wants to bring in investments in the country, moh wants, more accessibility of their lab capacity and health facilities want a very good level that is responding to the treatment plan that they have. and adding rssb, also interested, knowing what are people expecting from us in terms of reimbursing the services? are we talking about new services? are we talking about new lab tests new, different way of testing, same way of testing with more cost or less cost would, that would be of interest for us, if you can achieve more with less cost and i think yeah, they would be interested and it's good to bring all these perspectiveon one table. so that as a country we see what is at hand. so somehow all of them are, have incentives to participate i think so.",40,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_7
"so, the following question would be, so how interested are private partners in participating in the ppp? do you know anything about that?","very complicated. i think public has much more interest, because there are some inefficiencies that are public sector is always prone to have those, some inefficiencies that ppp can address. so when you are engaging in other provider even if, they're bringing, i don't know what they're bringing equipment consumables because the public interest is always overshadowing the business part of the model. so i think when you bring them together, public sector will benefit much more while in the private sector. if i was known of private clinic, i can't allow my equipment to sleep for one year, just because, there is no maintenance. i have a ways of addressing my issues already. so i think public will benefit more from ppp than private sector, but definitely on the investment.i think private sector also benefit from that joint venture, because , it can allow you to expand faster because there's someone's taking charge of part of the cost and,with and being reimbursed through. so for example, if i was to invest 1 million in, so my lab capacity in have a venture with a private company doing it for me, i can use that money to open another service and yeah, it can help private sector to expand faster. ",41,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_7
"so what are the private partnerâ€™s main questions around participating in ppp, what are the biggest incentives? so you summarize a little bit, what are the biggest drawbacks of private so, it depends on the interest as you have said, ",i don't see anyone who will be threatened ,42,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_7
so the government should have the best team to negotiate?,"maybe yes. maybe there were in the that value chainin that supply chain, there were private organization that were involved forexample supplying, uh, some of the consumables for the lab. and they were of course benefit from that, those ones. uh, if, if we are talking about a big, uh, manufacturing company, the role is prefer they have large supply network to they, they can't, they can't outsource, but i guess they will, they will not outsource because they rely on their own on their own supply chain. and because there is no particular value addition, the role is all, so try to minimize the cost of supply. so that's why that can push them to use their own services. so i think those are the only ones that will be losing from this. ",43,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_7
"so we are moving toward the end, sorry to keep you so long, so the discussion was very interesting. but we are moving for the pathway to sustainability and the scale up the things,","so if i didn't read the proposal and i don't understand the sector, i can't judge, or of course public sector has interest but also private investors have their own interest. so in if, you know, and there is a cost to that interest. so if government was not strong enough to defend, to at least minimize the cost of that increased lab capacity and quality, so constant quality of the services, you can get it, butat a very high cost. so, i can't judge, if i didn't understand where the proposal and what was in, you can get really that investment you can get good quality lab services, but it can come at a very huge cost if they didn't negotiate well but if they negotiated well, and if they realize that it's too costly, if they were the ones to do that investment, given their capability, the maintenance and whatever, if there was two cost three for them, then it's a good deal for the government. so i can't judge and i can't put in numbers what the population is benefiting because i donâ€™t know if that means more availabilitythenthe societal gains are also at, uh, they need to be accounted into who is gain and who is just losing. and i think government will do make some compromise just to make the services available services of good quality available. cause the health of the population also matters. ",44,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_7
"actually there are some question which are saying, under the sub question, which different sources of funding, are expectedto be used for financing the diagnostic, and howthe government, has increased the financing support to the diagnostic during the ppp period?for example, the national health insurance and other things, and also, to think about if the financing plan are sustainable?why, and the why not?","i think there are a lot of elements to consider. so i don't know, i was not part of this. and i gave you one example of one other expression of interest that was launched by the government and only one applicant was available. but i think there is one that is very key to determine how people are interested. even that particular applicant was the one who had full information about the ppp so i think you can judge that people are not interested if they have access to this information. if you have done fe visibility, you have shown them the numbers and put that expression of interest outside, then you will see how many are interested, if numbers were good. so financial projections risk analysis, if that is done and available to everyone, then i think there are other elements in the environment that will push people, attract people, the ecosystem. when you look at it that there is more attraction of investors in rwanda, so not coming doesn't mean that they don't like the investing in rwanda it's maybe because they don't know, they don't have enough information, to make those decisions.otherwise, when you look at the doing business they, the efforts that are, rdb is doingto give incentive to investors, if you add it to a good modelthatyou present to them when you publish the expression of interest, then people, i suspect that people would come in numbers. ",45,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_7
"based on the financing system in rwanda, for example do you think the existing financial mechanisms are sustainable for this kind of diagnostic financing? why, and why not? ","i think, one is the financial variability of a particular ppp the risk analysis and the government so the incentives by the government because there is so you can, the incentives in many ways in terms of success, in terms of i don't know. so if you, we are very clear that government is ready to give away these incentives. and this is the financial model. this is, if you're talking about lab test, for example, capacity, these are the millions of rwandans, receiving a test of malaria a year, and this is part of the ppp, then people can judge, and of course, that incentive, those incentives that rwanda gives to investors, for example, in terms of tax, in terms of land tax is to land access to, to whatever exclusivity in contracting, how many years i think every investor would do would look at it. so i think those are the elements that should be public and for people to judge, whether they go in okay. ",46,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_7
"okay, thank you very much that was very interesting. so, is there anything else you would like to discuss about the ppp that we're not covered in our talk?","i'm trying to think aloud. i think they're also interested in stability and we have not seen cases where government have not founded its promises in terms of, for the investments. so in other context, we might find, you have signed an agreement with the government when there is the next government it's, it becomes absolute and or they make you in a way or another, cause they didn't, they were not part of the deal. they find reasons to make you lose so that you go by yourself. because also the cost of stopping the contract is very high. many investors put that. so i think they have stability. what can prevent them from coming? i think the most element that in my knowledge that can hinder engaging engagement of private investors in the ppp is the capacity to and it is within the financial model. ",47,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_7
"yeah, exactly because we were able to interviewing so many people for us to be able to deep dive and know how the project were implemented or whether it is on the right direction , and we were able to get different perspectives from different levels. and at the end of the day, the most beneficiary it's the government of rwanda, and these stakeholders. so the findings should be shared to the government and even the most beneficiaries funders. then after we will be able to get different perspective from other countries to evaluate if there can be a best practice to implement in our country.","we don't have many, but few that we have, i think they have the capacity because they are, many of them have international collaborations, which is in addition to their capacity. so some of them either are a hundred percent rwandan, but with international collaboration, others are the branches of big private lab farms, which i think is even when you look at their capacity in with that extensioni think they have at least more capacity the public in that regards. ",48,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_7
thank you for your time and i appreciate. ,"i can't tell cause of two factors that i don't have one the loan they are offering is it better than the banks secondly, do they need that money? for example, if we are talking about those agencies of multilateral lab companies, probably they have more money, from the mother companies than they're not willing to incur any long cost. so since i don't have those two elements, i don't know if this is, interesting for them, but of course, if, if it was cheaper than the market and there is that need, then they would be willing to take it, but i can't speak on the need. i think there is a need capacity still low and, we are still sending some lab test outside in the country so it means there is room to improve capacity in the country.",49,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_7
for sure. ,if they don't have their money and if it is better than the banks. okay. ,50,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_7
"for sure this will run to some point in this discussion in this core group. and i know you are in the rwandan health sector forum, and you will catch it at any time in the meeting.","i think there are two ways to stream of financing and one is through health insurance, but knowing that the community, the insurance is the biggest, insurance in the country. and we know that it is financially. itâ€™s not very strong because they have very low contributions, which are not likely to increase, can increase only through government subsidies. so, the key elements to the sustainability is of course there is that minimum that is provided for, to everyone who is using. so at least the utilization of services is high and to remain high because majority of the population is insured and lab testing will be part of the care that they receive when you go to health facilities. so that is i think a very strong element for sustainability, but secondly, another element, which i don't master, but was very key is, the second,financing stream, which is through the government budget government has been investing in for example, biomedical equipment. ",51,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_7
so the first question that we have for you is we want you to describe your involvement in ahdp ppp process?,"i think the one part of sustainability is that financing since this government budget, i don't think that what goes through the government budget. i don't think that we stop tomorrow and members will not stop paying their contributions. so insurance is a sustainable way of having these services run. so now what can threaten the sustainability is the cost of running the lab. since i have not looked at the model, if it is reasonable enough for the public and private operators, not to lose through providing this service, just because insurance didn't pay didn't reimburse enough. so if that is guaranteed, then there is no other threat to sustainability. so we have to the costing model if it respected the affordability part of it sustainability would be guaranteed. ",1,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
"so then are you at least a little bit familiar with it later on, maybe you were not involved in the, the process at the beginning since the beginning, but at some point you were somehow informed or attended some meetings about it. ","yeah, i think this is the first time to be involved in this research. but as i said before, in country, we have a public private partnership project that has been running for some years. i think it started if i remember, well, it is around 2017, but i was not much involved in the project. and the information i may provide is not the information, like someone who has been involved in the design and running of the project.it is the information from someone who is in institution that has running the project.",2,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
and then do you know if your institutions was involved at some point?,yeah. the project was coordinated by the head of national reference laboratory. ,3,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
so this you are because you are not involved and your institutions also was not involved. do you know some of the specifics of this ppp the modality that were discussed during this ppp through the discussions that you had with your friends? ,yes i have ,4,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
"so then, based on the few information that you have, do you know who was involved in this ahdp ppp in this discussion around the design of this new partnership? ","according to what i know the private part is abbott, abbott who provided clinical chemistry, hematology, and molecular equipment. so abbott provide three types of equipment the negotiation was coordinated by rdb, rdb business experts. and rbc was providing the technical point of view and information needed in collaboration with abbot. rdb designed negotiation document ",5,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
then we are still going to go through what you heard about these ppp through different people. ,"i think we considered all the health facility levels at initial stage national reference lab had the three types of equipment. we took two teaching university hospitals, which is, chuk, chub and recently appointed. we have recently appointed them as referral hospital. i think ruhengeri and kibungo then, well, we considered also some hospitals which are on the borders, byumba, gisenyi, gihundwe and these are the satellite lab. yeah because equipment needs some infrastructure to accommodate them so i think all the hospital, all the levels were placed at district hospital provincial and referral hospitals and the national reference lab. but an assessment was conducted to see the volume of samples tested on the selected hospitals as the basis of negotiation.",6,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
"and then for the ppp, i think, you know, the context and, you know how, which works in rwanda","i thinkthe starting point was to compare thepriceofreagents and consumablesbutthis was the initial stagewhere especially the partner, the abbott was sticking onit requestedthe cost involvedat least one test. actually abbott wanted, we provided the cost it took us to run lab tests. yes. ",7,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
"okay. so do you, are you aware of the different options that were discussed during this ppp especially when they were designing the model, the final model to be adopted? do you have any information about the potential model that were discussed? ","i said it is rbc and rdb teams and if i remember well the design was coordinated by rbc by the business unit and bios department was providing the technical information needed but the former director of business unit was the one who coordinated the design. chai came in later in the evaluation of the project. well, i don't have much information but i think rdb was involved and mof was involved come in to validate the process",8,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
"it's good. okay. so you know, that ahdp is a ppp about lab diagnostic, so really focusing on improving access quality of that while being also afford to the rwandan population. ",it was based on the cost.,9,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
"it was mainly, looking at first of all, the public sectors, improving what the services are in the public sector. ",yes. about reduced the cost. we were comparing to the existing running costs of different laboratory tests.abbott reduces the cost not to go beyond to what we use to today.,10,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
"so, here we have the next set of questions, me looking at how the policy context and the different stakeholders can shape the ppp design. so the question is about, the legal system in place in country. and how is it supportive, to the ppp when you look at the existing policy legal and regulatory framework that we have in rwanda ","i don't have much detail of the negotiation, but what i think is we were trying because we were trying to have the cost, which is not expensive. ",11,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
"so meaning you are suggesting that you are saying, first of all that people have a different mindset and we may face challenges and resistance yes. from players and in rwanda, we're not necessarily into ahdp, but in ppp arrangement in general, andto try to address these resistance, it's going to be good to share like examples or experiences across different sectors to show that ppp can work. it's not necessarily the devil. it can work and can get good outcomes out of it. ",i think it is between rdb and mof i'm not sure which among them. ,12,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
"so can you then based on your experiences, so what are the projects that have been there in country that can provide lessons to these ahdp ppp? ","i think there is three options for us is to have equipment free of charge yes, because it is a placement model.having equipment, availing maintenance services and capacity building, this is a three services, which has to be offered at free of charge , but of course abbott as a business institution has to recover all those coststhroughthe reagent over time. ",13,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
so you didn't move on with that ambulance project? ,i do not have much information about this.,14,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
"how was the collaboration, the relationship between public and private especially, for example, if you look at the one that actually worked okay implemented with the health post, with ofh and sfh?","i didn't yet know once we implemented the ppp, if it'll be easy, why? cause if you can see, we have social cases, in most of our hospitals, we have social cases like people from, i think, with the one and with the too, which don't pay which the government to pay for we have many social cases in the hospitals for me, i didn't yet, currently i take abbott the ppp of abbott currently it is running, it is running like any other placement, because even for roche, we have placement equipment they keep received through leasing system which the equipment is placed. then we only buy reagent with extra cost we have some few equipment for roche in this framework butif we can take the lab management we offer it to a private company.i think there will be two challenges. one as once for the, the lab, the lab generated incomes to be managed by a private company. every client has to pay. and i'm not sure if you will manage to pay for all the social cases because was we buy reagents, we offer service business oriented. so ours is to serve and we don't focus on the vestment and benefits, but once the business company comes in, i think they have to work for benefits. this is number one, number two, who also most of the labs are most of the hospitalsurvive from the incomes generated from the lab. so i think those two things, i think, need to be a challenge be the challenge. ",15,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
so then what has been the historic investment and interest from government in lab diagnostic?,"okay. accessibility. i think access, the package may be increased because there is the hospitals do not offer to the do not the clients yet the equipment itself can, can offer the service. but the problem is not the, the reagents, which is not purchased accessibility, i think. but affordability, i think it is a challenge. ",16,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
"so looking at ahdp, you know, a little bit about ahdp what is the goal of the ahdp? so according to you who are the key stakeholders that should sit around the table when they're discussing ahdp ppp?","i think i mentioned before. so i think we talked about the cost and turnaround time and i think it can be reduced.but as the cost, i don't think it can change because all of them are in business. yes. the business way it is designed to, to invest in the recovery, which you invest okay.",17,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
"so then how does these different these different stakeholders that you have listed, how do they perceive their advantages and disadvantages of the ppp?",covid-19 affected the ppp design because abbott platforms they did not meet the volume sample needed to be tested.the volume of samples was huge while the machine could run few compared to the volume. ,18,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
"so, and then whose interest are helped or hurt by laboratory diagnostics happening in the public versus the private sector? ","i think there is a burden of finance, which will be reduced so burden will be reduced. finance is always a challenge in any business.",19,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
"so then this is the next question who is potentially threatened by the ppp, especially here in rwanda what if we work, we come up with this ppps design where we are bringing the public sector with the expertise of the private sector and doing this joint venture to improve the public sector, like diagnostic network. so who is going to potentially be threatened? ",not be possible. so i'm not yet. sure.,20,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
or in organization or any? ,"the existing policy. yeah, the regulatory, i think the rppa framework, don't support to offer the tender to one person the procurement policy and framework is open while the ppp is closed the tender.",21,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
could we say that those are going to be the most the people are benefiting the most from this public private partnership. ,i do not have much information about this. i'm not sure. ,22,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
"so how interested are private partners you think in participating in ppp like this large, ahdp ppp especially in our context? ","not really much. i can view the people who were involved, ",23,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
"so, so you mean that people, if they're not coming is because they may not have all the necessary informationso what are then these information that they may need, they want to know to have to be attracted?","but i think they are different because abbott is the business company, i think ahdp manage a private company to facilitate the mediation between the government and the business companies. i think they're quite different.",24,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
"what are the big you have listed some of the incentives, what are then the drawbacks for a private partner? what are some of the drawbacks that may hinder the participation of these partners? ","i donâ€™t have much information on this as i was not involved currently we have many partners in the lab, chai is in charge of the monitoring of this ppp and providing technical support and facilitating in issue of finance.",25,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
"so, and then do you think that the private partners that we have here in working in lab do you think that they have the capacity to participate and deliver on a ppp? especially when we are looking at the ppp the ppp that ahdp was looking at was really something that is big, where, uh, could move from just doing sample transportation to something that is like co-management of lab network. ","the first one is the incomes generated from the lab. the second one. as i said, there is always social cases, which don't pay services. is the support of the government, the third one and it's the partner different partners have in country. ",26,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
"so do you think that private partners that we have in the country will be interested in taking up the, this available financial instrument offered by ahdp? ","we may say no, because sometimes the, the support keeps decreasing. ",27,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
"so these financial instruments may somehow, i don't know, good incentives to them, maybe to participate?","but for me, i thinkwell, i think even if what maybe we didn't discuss is that if you can see how abbott was designed at initial stageand how it was implementedi thinkit didn't reach its objectives. the initial plan was to take the management of public laboratories but currently have the project being run it is the, it is like a placement system, like other partners. they wanted to run labs. manage the incomes generated then shares the incomes generated between the government and themselves. but if you can sell the project is being run. it is like any other you system so i may not say ppp project, as it was designed, it didn't reach its objectives. ",28,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
"so now this last question is about sustainability and scale up. so especially looking at, the public sector financing. ","i was not involved in the implementation much involved with the implementation, but what i think was the challenge to not reach this objectives. i first one is the social cases which don't pay medical or laboratory services. two. it is the incomes which support most the hospitals which support most the hospitals the funds generated which helps functionality of hospitals.",29,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_23
"so please, can you describe your involvement in the ppp process and the african health diagnostic platform in rwanda? ","so i worked as a senior associate on chai rwanda team. i provided the lab technical inputs on the ahdp work alongside my colleagues, one of them had more knowledge in the costing side of the work. the other one had the overall oversight over the strategic direction alongside the global team.but my role was the lab technical work on the team.",1,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
thank you very much. who is that person who has the information so we can target him/ her for this interview? ,"yes, i am. ",2,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
"there is no problem. you can provide the information that you can have but you are familiar with this african health diagnostic platform, as it has been coordinated at national reference laboratory. at least you have some information on it?","yes, yes. okay.",3,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
so what was the process of negotiation of this ppp?,"so what happened was that there was a prior assessment of the lab network. the lab network, where we realized and we have listed a number of challenges. after documenting the challenges in the different lab system areas from policy to quality assurance. we then took a time understanding the entire ppp model, what are the guidelines for rwanda. so with a clear understanding on the ppp steps, we were able to then propose a number of models, privatization that we thought would address the challenges in the country. and also reduce the cost in terms of running laboratories, and also improve efficiencies laboratory services.",4,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
"how did this process vary by topic, for example, the facility selection, procurement model and the contract type, including referral network and other things? ","so, we had the one discussion with the major stakeholder. the ministry of health, rbc. when we had that it was with ministry of health and rwanda national laboratory. when we discussed, they realized basically this kind of stating the problem and we had the solution to it. but also we had discussions with the number of other stakeholderâ€™s agreement assurance companies, private sector.",5,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
so what were the sticking point around the ppp design and how will they resolved? ,"we had mainly the rssb, that was one of those the first one, but also, we looked at the other the military medical insurance a bit, and looked at the deals that are being activated, the costs that were going into healthcare laboratory services from those, and their price ranges. so that's what we looked at. yes, we had discussions with the private labs. we did also with some kind of private labs, i don't remember which one exactly. but i remember like the lancet, how they offer the services and how much. and then we compared with the how much has been offered and decide. so, well we conducted a number of contacts with hospitals, regional andreferral hospital. and then the other stakeholder was minecofin understanding. we also had the rdb team we had discussions with them. and of course with our global teams, and we had to discuss a number of modalities, but to the stakeholders really that are off my head.",6,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
"who has been involved in the initial design of the ppp on the side of the government, on the side of the, the partners, ","so, we had a lot of input from the national reference laboratory and ministry of health that was a key people, but also we had a lot of back and forth with some stakeholders who are not really present on site that minecofin and rssb but the major people we had present in front of us were mainly. rdb and ministry of health and national reference laboratories and also we had minenfra.",7,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
"how did the initial design change and during the deliberations,","one is that when we did this study, we did a feasibility assessment. in the laboratory network, we identify those challenges. then, we did a feasibility study kind of being a rigorous analysis on technical and financial sites or risk analysis, kind of evaluating the cost and impact implications for such partnership.but what we got later on was that there was a lot of doubt in our findings from the assessment, because we had 2019 data, they said no, get updated data that captures data maybe from 2020 to 2021.",8,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
"yes. so they did they, did they change the cost? ",yeah. so i think we had a rough estimate that we did an investment of around $20 million to build a structure to expand this surface of service offerings. and we thought that would come from the cbhi and government insurance and in patients. and then the private part now needs a kind of cape index around. was it 15 million or 10 i don't remember very well i don't have access to those files already.,9,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
"how did this change affect the process, would affect the process of the design and the negotiation?","there is a policy that is all the property from these remains, and i think i also had to sign a nondisclosure agreement with a rwanda biomedical center, so i had no authority to take any copies of this file. okay. so, they were protected by our supervisor.",10,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
so who or which institution would have been ultimately responsible for approving the ppp design? ,"yes, but then if you could introduce a better service offering in terms of the number of tests that can be offered, you could also improve efficiencies in the system, practice better or services for this population, but this was actually refused.",11,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
"what option were all are still being consider when designing the model. so the different contracting options, for example, the consideration geographical spread. so refer network like that","so, we had, i think we got stuck on the fighter recommendations, getting their recommendations and their models, because this is the study we took a lot of time, if we had the final recommendation approved by rdb then would be able to launch a tender. and then also contracts offer contract and implement the ppp but we never went to pass that we remained on the recommendations and the models, and we kept with revising that i think we looked at this, the status poor where it was a public responsibility. we look at the under the call session where we had to privatize the entire system. apart from the infrastructure of the laboratory space, this is a government property. then we had another model which was called co-management, whereby the aspects of the laboratory like staff, the data, and the infrastructure handled by the government, and then the rest like instruments, procurements, capacity building, those things have quite a control as managed by the private person. but we also had challenges where we said okay, if you had a private partner has no control over staff and their compensation, does not have things around patient that are the data tracking and recording. even we do not understand the modalities over enumeration of the private partner because they'll be getting a kind of commission or after the offering of the service from government agencies, then it would be very hard. so, yeah and that's why the initial models then we ended up in things like sample transport.",12,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
"how appropriate is the design of african health diagnostic platform public private partnership to the local context? for example political, social, economic and technological environmental housing, the agnostic market.","yeah, we had to add the cut some of the designs which were acceptable. and it was the feedback from the gentleman who joined later on, he replaced the former division manager of rnl.",13,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
"how would an ideal public private partnership design accommodate the need of apriority population, for example, the poor household, the complicated patients? ","it was more acceptable address our immediate concerns, like sample transport. because someone used to say that if you brought me a private partner who can manage my sample transport system, so without me having to invest so much energy and staff in managing sample transport, i will sign that contract but give me all the things that are privatization i cannot sign such a contract. he was also in agreement that yes sample transport to be something really acceptable for someone who manages laboratory accreditation, because i think that is a massive gap there was only one love that quote accreditation in the rest of the models.",14,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
so how would the ppp design address key considerations to improve access of laboratory diagnostics in ppp is proposed?,"so, the next we have looked at we had put a kind of statu quo, looking at things like the staff hiring and what all those who are managed by the public. then we said, can you fully privatized a concession. they operate directly within the hospitals, the private law that they disagree. they said we cannot handle our laboratories to the private plan, it would need serious approval from the higher levels, i think this can do that by then, the co- management kind of caused issues. the public labs, they continue to operate with the private sector partner. that basically we recommended at highest volume labs where the private partner would maybe gain some level of income from volumes. so that co management came to where they would not understand. okay. our staff, and then patient and this data, managing that data, but who would be in charge of collecting the funds from the different sources, and how much would we end up paying, the private lab partner will be supporting? so those were things that took so long to negotiate. how much would they pay and what kind of payment mechanism in place, so it took so long.seemed also been not because we limited them with few things like infrastructure staff, patient data. we left the rest of the things like capacity building, mentorship, procurement and supply chain. the things and also like the maintenance of equipment, we left them entirely to the private partner, okay those we talked to were either concerned about not being able to determine the staff hiring and conversation. because if people are not meeting their targets, then it kind of affects their performance.they need to have full control of staffing. and the thing is that also the private partner looked at lower staffing, because they would be able to motivate them better to hit the targets much better for them, even for the profit. but the government said no we cannot release our staff. let go of staff. and then, where do they go.",15,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
so what factors do you think changed the discussion around the ppp? ,"so we had a steering committee. the steering committee had the honorable minister. think of it a dg we had some people from rnl, from the ministry of health. but you would wake up tomorrow and the cabinet has changed someone, the honorable minister is no more, or the dg has been relieved of his duties, or the lab director is no longer there. so, introducing the same concept to a new person, every single time, took us back a lot.so that was the major problem, you would have a champion today. then tomorrow you don't have a champion, they are no longer there at moh, or they are no longer there in rnl, there is no longer someone who is part of the work.",16,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
so how has covid-19 affected the ppp design? ,"we had the former division manager of rnl. we also had the current dg of planning at moh, we also had the former country director of chai and we had the current minister of health. and then we had to be introduced to him but before anything went to rdb, or the committee that said we needed to have a sign of by the honorable minister. and so the switch from then to that. again, caused the problem then the dg was changed, and then we had another issue altogether. and then were there before we knew it, rbc was changed, and rnl was changed. i then took him to refer to the new clinical division manager. and so i think later on he was saying, okay let's try to do something around sample transport. so, in the entire model.",17,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
"so if ahdp is providing a technical support and the facilitating financing for these ppp, how will the availability of this support affect the ppp design? ","yes. so the honorable minister would be the one to sign off the steering committee recommendations, before it goes up to rdb. and then from there, the rdb if they signed off at rdb that would launch a tender and start the negotiations, but i think we never crossed that, because we constantly remained at moh. but i think later on we realized that there is another problem. we were dealing a lot with the moh, and the people there and everything but also hoping that the nrl was backing us up but later on we realized they said no. we need to be the lead as a lab program, it has to be nrl owned. so we said but you have been part of this discussion all along, again you want it to be back to you before we proceed again. so, there was a kind of conflict a bit in terms of institutions.",18,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
so what are the features of ppp design that would not be possible without ahdp technical support?,"copy that, we only had complete a different direction. whenever we would have a change in leadership. so those are the things but also, i think it was mainly the change of leadership would have it at a different challenge. there will be like throwing different ideas entirely. yeah.",19,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
so the how supportive is the existing policy legal and the regulatory framework for the ppps? ,"so they were more comfortable with a sample transport co-management. so i think that was a little bit understandable. and it wasn't really bringing also changes to the lab network or asking someone to take off the entire, it was actually addressing the main challenge in terms of sample transport and sites. so that was probably the most acceptable we had discussions to we were more advanced. yeah.",20,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
how much resistance among policymakers will this people need to overcome to garner the necessary support?,"so, i think what they said, we had a discussion late last year when we realized now we might not have enough. yeah, we have done the laboratory diagnostic network optimization looking at the lab system recommending all kinds of changes, and this was alongside their pre-feasibility study. facing the challenges and also on the dno side we had instructed some changes that will improve the lab network, and a few other things and the recommendations were accepted on dno. but when i think the new leadership at the nrl said they needed to implement changes in the lab network. so, for a period of time for example, one year, two years, then assess the improvements. and what areas, before taking on any ppp with that all models. so, okay, we realize we're coming at the end of the grant and people have gotten back to that as fast you turn our own assess the network, see what things we have improved, and then get back to you on which kinds of model. so we had discussions with the bmgf.",21,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
"what other recent or area experiences or project have there been in a country that can provide lessons for ahdp? i think this is, what you have been discussing. and you were involved in the abbott.","okay, so one of the things that we set out to address. they were four things. access, improve access, improving timeliness, improving the quality and the cost, reducing the cost of diagnostic network. so those are the things that we wanted to set out to transform. okay, some a lot of coverage, good results, good quality, and at less cost. then we did the prefeasibility assessment showed us clearly that, for example, the turnaround time was more than two months from sample collection to results delivery, the national policy, the service offering. i think they were around 100 plus tests but for 27 were being offered by the public labs. imagine having 100 plus test but you can only offer of 20 something or thirty and health centers had 50% less than the test that were kind of made service package.",22,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
how the experience of abbott was similar or different from african health diagnostic platform?,"so the health insurance the red one was the rate was much lower than the market offering for reagents. and this would need further discussions to get the agreed upon. so, in all that we submitted and all the things. there was still going to be a challenge with national insurance cases because we had really addressed the discussions for that in terms of pricing. i think there's a lady at moh. i don't remember the name very well, she took on that discussion passionately, but it had never been resolved, and i think i left unresolved. to this day, i don't know. tell me what is going on.",23,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
so who are the key stakeholders in the ppp? and why are they involved? ,"exactly you know the tariffs, it was made way back, but things have changed their improvement this which have come up with, and the costs have gone up.",24,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
"what are, or could be the plans in a place to support the public sector financing of diagnostic in the future? so which different source of funding are expected to be used for financing diagnostic? ",in my own opinion i always thought his excellence would help us with that such a problem.,25,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
do you have information about how government increased financing support to diagnostic during the ppp period of for example the,"you know, the people listen to the president, a lot.",26,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
so what is the consequence of not reaching this initial plan for the system?,"i think it is made to allow the laboratory to take their efforts in improving the laboratory system. according to the dno recommendations, assess the impact of their work in a year or so, then do a quick feasibility to see what the remaining gaps are. and with that, you can design a model that addresses the challenges that have not been addressed by their efforts. because, i mean i have not travelled so widely but i can say that the government staff, the government of rwanda, people really work hard and passionate about the work they're passionate about the way they work. so they work hard. i'm comparing with my uganda where staff come and by 2pm they have disappeared.so, if i'm to compare yes, rwanda had passionate about their work, but take on efforts that then assess what they need based on that, then they would accept okay we had that for two years. at this point, so we need help on this area. so, there are the big quick reassessment of the lab network, and then kind of tweak the recommendations based on their knit at the time. so then maybe it will be acceptable. but without them trying their best, they would feel people have just jumped in without helping. yeah.",27,rwa_int_pe_2021_12_10
"so the first question that we have for you we want to understand your involvement in the ppp process, under the african health diagnostic platform in rwanda. so if you can please describe your involvement.","so i think we need to understand faster, i would need to fully understand the landscape of the laboratory. i would still do a proper feasibility study of the lab. so kind of study but also the last thing i would widen the net in terms of stakeholders, not limited to a few nuclear change, if you have to introduce to others, but have everyone on the table, not just a steering committee but how people constantly engaged to show them the benefit of the ppp or not activity, and then also the other bit. i think i would have an earlier discussions with the private sector and the insurance companies, they couldn't be government owned or community based, but they could also be privately or understand, what can manage what cannot be managed. but also i think one of the things that would need to help a country would be start immediately from the get go, negotiating the real debt course and including things like bundling price per test.and then, just the reagents, so that the manufacturer, as always, in the country agents of manufacturers are aligned with the country need in terms of cost, and the volumes that are available in the country. so, that is what i think i would do.",1,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
"okay. so, we can say that you're pretty familiar with the project. right.","i don't know, that is a valid one but i think. we had a scenario whereby people are fully engaged we were discussing with them and then covid-19 hit. around march. and the discussion died because the entire ministry, just jumped on covid-19. that's the time again and they added live with the conversation after a pandemic was another thing altogether. you know, we all went in lockdown. so i can say, that was one of the things the conversation died at one momentum so that is one factor. that also affected things like the cost higher. why it is higher why is the cup subsidy going higher. people are not willing to pay more money. out of pocket money, cbhi is not going to put more money in these. so that is one of the things. yeah.",2,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
so you participated in each of the state of this process.,"because the entire ppp deals live on someone being able to get the loan facility. we never felt like the lab way to get the whole sell loan to build the infrastructure according to the standard. the other loan they got was for setting up the nrl, the new facility under the european investment bank. but it was entirely outside the ahdp so it could have affected i don't know really, because they got what they wanted. in terms of getting loan to run the system and then paid slowly we never felt people wanted to hear anything like getting loan. they wanted to see something around can a private partner bringing down their own money, and run their thing and then get out when we don't want them anymore. so, the loan thing was a sticking point.",3,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
"and. okay, the first part of this interview is going to look at the specifics related to the design negotiation.","yeah, so that's one of the things, loans, approved really high up there may be at the highest level so it can kind of came up to the sticky point.",4,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
"so we would like to know how, what was the process of negotiation of these ppp? for example, the process during selection of facilities where this initiative was planned to be implemented, the model that was chosen, how did all this process go. if you can describe that for us?","so i find the regulatory environment quite bureaucratic. it's so devoid of people who make decisions. it is only made of people who relay the information higher up for someone else to make a decision, people steered clear with the hard of decision.",5,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
"so i would like to better understand, especially when it comes to the models. so because the different models that you proposed, i think you had some discussions.","yeah, people were a little bit fearful of making decisions. the only thing that i think once i find is that, rwanda has the rules that are basically avoid any form of corruption and is good. and so it being watertight, and with all those steps is a good thing.and it's good to see a country that follows the guidelines to the letter and does not kind of bypass procurement steps. for example in uganda, someone who come talk to the honorable minister, the contract to be signed tomorrow. in rwanda that will not happen. so, me being an upside fast admired, i admired that people are following to the letter. for example, for abbott deal i think it was signed in 2016 to do a feasibility, and i don't know that they have signed the full thing to this day. ",6,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
excuse me when you say insurance companies. can you say which ones?,"so that's one of the things that the steps are very rigorous, but i think they're supposed to be corruption proof. and so the thing is they are really bureaucratic so you have got to be. i think bmgf needed to give it time, the timelines they were giving for the very controlled environment. without any bureaucracy or something, or quickly get someone, pick a contract. okay, let's go for tender how fast know the speed at which you are giving it will not be taken on by every government, equally. you know other government have their processes and i think we need to respect the government processes, and the timings.so, be flexible to hear things like let's first do our own effort then do another feasibility.so, i think, the bmgf needed to hear that, but with a strict timelines that was a controlled environment that would not work, i don't know either kenya managed to do it really or ghana, with ethiopia fully.",7,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
"putting together these different models. so they had like you discuss the model, or it was just stakeholders that were involved in providing information.for example, on cost, on average because we want really to understand, during the discussion onwhen you were shaping, designing the different options to understand who were the people in the room. during this step.","yeah, so, like bmgf and eib pushing us get the thing on. we need to get the loan. so it was kind of got us in a sticky point, because we were pushing too hard, and government entities when you push too hard it looks a little bit tricky.",8,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
"okay, so then during the next question is really looking at, i think you had those discussions, a lot of back and forth between the different teams and people are bringing some concerns you trying to address their concerns.","we had hard time deadlines with bmgf, we were having sleepless nights. but the sleepless nights were not because of the government, they were because of them.",9,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
"itâ€™s really interesting, we were struggling to get people who were really involved.since the beginning to have a better understanding of the process. and i think you have a lot of information as a technician who were involved like, highly involved in all these technical steps. ","i think rwanda has exemplified that they're open to ppp. they have several, i think on orthopedics or something. i think eye care or something. but the sticky point is, get a loan. i think stood out really hard for them, we're open to someone working with us and partnering with us and we signed a contract and all of that. but we're going to be take a loan in immediately without understanding why are we getting loan for",10,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
"omg, you didnâ€™t save them into your computer, for example? ","injecting money and negotiating yes, and they're open to having a section of the healthcare, is a priority needs addressed by private partner. but compared to other countries rwanda has been open to private partners, just that i think this one stood out really clearing with a loan issue and the pace at which we were pushing the government to get a side deal and get a loan.",11,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
"oh, i just wanted to understand better the cbhi right so based onyour calculation estimation so you found that the rate, the theory for the cbhi may increases and that's why you had all these people disagreeing with that.","not really heard of it, and i only knew that portable private players in the lab sector, like lancet but. in terms of any other issues or laboratory private sector, i really not heard of it. and now when i remember there was something that also rwanda was open to. and we had a discussion with the global public health foundationgphfheaded by professor and his company offers services for laboratory accreditation. and so, they thought if such a person came in and they sourced funding from cdc. in terms of a grant to support the government. it is basically picked from uganda. what cdc did in uganda was to get gphf to support public laboratories towards accreditation, you know.and so that kind of a private player coming in applying for cdc grant, so that was something we had discussions with them and were open to it but it still come back that even if we had, we got this people on getting a loan from eib they've been used to gettingthe funding from examples, petfar.but petfar in rwanda was not opened to such. they kind of work different.",12,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
"yeah, i understand. i think i participated in one of the virtual meetings where they could see also that there was an increasing in the health insurances, especially the cbhi will pay. and i remember that some people were like no, how we can think its increasing. so someone from your team tried to explain that actually this is because we're providing more services also we have more efficiency.","so the biggest incentive to join was that there's money to be made. but i think the concerns were is there really volume. in terms of test for the people. so we exemplified volume, because more volume means more gains, but also, what are the payment modality by government, you know. so that was something that also stood out how we would get compensated when we offer these services. i think those were the drawbacks really.",13,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
"so actually what we can say here is that the initial design as you said you were proposing co-management or privatization, but then because of all these challenges that you faced the one that you discussed then you had to propose other design, after like the sample transportation.","i think in the country, they are those private partners were basically again still from outside mainly south africa like lancet, you could see they have the capacity to do, but the realcountry ones we're not really having capacity. they are mainly outside as would be inside too, many outsiders that are working inside. for the local ones there is no that big capacity yet.",14,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
"so they proposed the sample transportation, it was more acceptable. ","i cannot get off my head right now. but i think the ppp model, there is need to continue this conversation because it would benefit the people me i so firsthand that would benefit the people.no matter how much the government put in and pushes. they are just some skills that you can only pick from outside. for example, accreditation of laboratories things around the sample transport. you see blood transfusion has been drastically visualized in rwanda, which is a big thing people see drones, because they were being managed by someone. so i think, should be a conversation that is handled and discussed by these people, and we see. i think it's worthwhile. so that why they should be starting the new discussion.",15,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
and what i was going to ask. and model that you proposed before the other designs. so what did they say about it. the other around co-management or privatization so they said okay let's start with this one it's more acceptable it's addressing one of the most urgent problem that we have sample transport.,"i will think one. there is a need for bmgf or wherever is still interested in a private is in this ahdp to give it some more time. and in one, improve the capacity, the understanding of government. of their services and also the priorities that lies within the private sector. so that would be a good need to educate the private sector, on what they can do to address the challenges that opportunities that are in the government to address these challenges so capacity building is one thing, knowledge sharing, open transparent technology and sharing, but also bmgf can facilitate that process to see that is actually increased the understanding of the role of the private sector within public institution. so that is something that needs a lot of time to try to be grounded and everything, and it should be i think now when they have not yet forgotten about it. and people should be able to do that so that is one good thing that i think is needed to be done.",16,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
"so something else that we wanted to understand better along this process, you have this different actors that were involved in this process of designing the ppp, did the main actors changed along the process and how these changes affected the continuity of the process to the final discussion","so the other thing i think which fell out of my mind a recommendation would be the ngos that are working with either bmgf or nothing to support that should have some form of support, dedicated support for people who sit at the ministry on a day to day sitting at their ministry. people who were embedded into the system. so, that would be, kind of bring more trust to the process, and also interact with every day. i think that's very important when you have people embedded in this team, while working within a daily on many other tests. you could decide to remember it. a government official works at the ministry who is like a champion or something, but i think that gives more liberal.",17,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
"and like you said, but also maybe that's what we felt also from some of these interviews we've been able to do. like some people who came after we're not briefed on the larger project,ahdp. when you change the administration sometimes some of the activities that were implemented are stopped.","yeah, so two things really matter a lot motivating people financially to get work done. because, i mean, you could hire them or make them seconded to their ministry, but they should be embedded in the system to get more buy in.",18,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
"okay. so, and then you know who have been responsible for approving the ppp designs in the process. you said the minister, right, is the one was going to be responsible for approving the ppp before anything.","yeah, i also felt like, imagine i was ugandan, my colleagues were from america i mean, tell me the rwandan component in that. so we wanted someone from national because we were never seated at the ministry of health even at nrl, we would just visit a few meetings, we never seated at rdb we were seated in our office, most of the time.",19,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
"interesting. and during this process of designing these models. so, you didnâ€™t have maybe some other people that were taking you to a complete different direction.","we worked with them to look at dealing with lhasa, who was many tasked and best, but if you hired people and seconded them to moh and then seconded them to rdb and asked them to understand the internal challenges, you know, read the minds of the leaders, to see there will be champions, even if with a change of minister or a dg, they actually show institutional picture, they are kind of enumerated by you but they are embedded in the system the locals, they are nationals, and they areidentified with everything.",20,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
"so, until you left. because maybe you didn't know, after that so what were the option that people were considering. it was after with all the different models that you presented. so, towards the end, what was the model that was considered the most?","so, and i want to come back to rwanda and see how the dno and i was very passionate about the dno recommendations. i would like to come back and see how further progressed and meet the former head of department of biomedical services.",21,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
"but it wasn't addressing all the problem, it was addressing, i think one of the main problem but what about the other problems. what was their plan to address them?","he hasnâ€™t even implemented his design, and now he is gone. i can say that i have never seen a country that has so many changes in short time. i dealt with some stakeholders it is understandable, it is also a method. that's why probably you are the least corrupt in your region. so, it's a nonsense kind of thing, i think, i don't know.",22,rwa-int-pe_2022_2_1
